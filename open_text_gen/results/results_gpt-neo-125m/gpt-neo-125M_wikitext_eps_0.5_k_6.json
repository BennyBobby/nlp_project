His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II, and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term, and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in March 1966 to plan the deployment. The year before, Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co @-@ operation role when it finally did deploy. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command, Melbourne, on 8 August 1966. Support Command had been formed in 1959, by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands. On 1 January 1968, Headlam was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff.

The city originally had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites. A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African @-@ American library was demolished on May 28, 2008. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 383, 1748, 318, 262, 10033, 1748, 287, 262, 46348, 11, 13797, 8495, 515, 5991, 9498, 357, 360, 5673, 10612, 543, 3407, 7724, 2488, 11, 31, 11546, 12503, 351, 22884, 3279, 11, 290, 262, 2254, 4789, 318, 262, 4387, 1171, 2615, 319, 8774, 8878, 357, 262, 2254, 4789, 318, 319, 262, 7627, 1735, 11, 290, 262, 584, 1735, 13, 383, 6832, 389, 5140, 319, 262, 4675, 13, 1119, 389, 5140, 319, 257, 4675, 326, 318, 13, 383, 2615, 318, 257, 734, 12, 13571, 2615, 11, 3170, 319, 734, 12, 392, 12, 64, 12, 325, 5154, 4308, 13, 554, 262, 2615, 11, 257, 2060, 4324, 318, 2810, 329, 262, 2615, 13, 383, 2615, 318, 635, 257, 734, 12, 13571, 11, 3170, 319, 257, 1440, 12, 325, 5154, 4308, 11, 290, 340, 318, 257, 734, 290, 257, 734, 12, 13571, 2615, 13, 554, 262, 6832, 612, 318, 257, 2219, 2166, 11, 262, 2166, 3420, 11, 290, 257, 2166, 3420, 13, 383], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions", "generated_result": {"0": ", and the City Hall is the largest public building on Main Avenue ( the City Hall is on the east side, and the other side.

In light of this, the National Hurricane Center estimated Beatriz to have attained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) along with a barometric pressure of 977 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 85 inHg ) ; however, it was noted that this could be conservative based on estimates of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) from the University of Wisconsin and the Satellite Analysis Branch. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 24581, 262, 3329, 286, 2795, 2310, 11, 12568, 47847, 31782, 262, 7051, 286, 5828, 11, 351, 262, 3641, 6427, 7323, 1315, 21504, 357, 1160, 10571, 1267, 5366, 2488, 12, 31, 26015, 11, 290, 788, 7421, 284, 262, 5093, 11, 6427, 546, 1160, 10571, 5366, 286, 2986, 16852, 390, 360, 4267, 13, 1629, 1088, 718, 9114, 319, 262, 3329, 706, 326, 340, 373, 1598, 329, 12568, 47847, 11, 351, 645, 584, 9725, 11, 326, 262, 2975, 373, 9087, 5366, 379, 262, 886, 286, 663, 7002, 13, 198, 1026, 318, 262, 717, 640, 326, 262, 10816, 12763, 468, 1683, 587, 3190, 31285, 625, 262, 2104, 1499, 11, 290, 262, 938, 640, 373, 262, 717, 640, 257, 12763, 550, 587, 31285, 625, 5828, 2254, 11, 543, 287, 262, 1613, 550, 587, 262, 3641, 290, 262, 5651, 6513, 286, 867, 286, 663, 9725, 11, 1390, 262, 530, 326, 373, 262, 1388, 530, 13, 198, 198, 464, 717, 2975, 373, 3170, 416, 262, 10816], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Throughout the morning of June 21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15 mi ( 20 km ) south @-@ southeast", "generated_result": {"0": ", and then west to the north, passing about 20 km south of San Juan de Dios.

The song talks about personal empowerment and self @-@ sufficiency, denoting a shift in focus of Madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like \" Everybody \" ( 1982 ), \" Vogue \" ( 1990 ) or \" Music \" ( 2000 ) which was centered around the subject of music itself. Among the various remixes, the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston's \" I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) \" with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction. Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other, from the time they wrote the song \" Heart \" ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it. The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album Disco Four. Madonna's voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook. A breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends, leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 16348, 28879, 9413, 286, 31214, 3000, 2630, 326, 366, 19061, 366, 318, 262, 366, 5062, 338, 12841, 2610, 366, 290, 326, 340, 318, 257, 366, 4767, 13705, 17528, 2488, 19355, 1, 5062, 13, 632, 318, 257, 366, 4767, 13705, 17528, 6, 5062, 13, 198, 1, 632, 4909, 734, 7259, 326, 423, 587, 366, 366, 366, 366, 24018, 1, 366, 366, 366, 366, 366, 220, 366, 366, 366, 198, 198, 1, 366, 4767, 13705, 17528, 2488, 19355, 464, 5062, 338, 366, 366, 366, 366, 290, 326, 338, 366, 366, 366, 366, 366, 366, 4767, 13705, 17528, 1, 198, 198, 1, 383, 43578, 8548, 2933, 4097, 318, 257, 366, 4273, 12, 24643, 7081, 4097, 1, 198, 198, 1, 4767, 13705, 17528, 2488, 19355, 464, 5062, 318, 530, 286, 262, 749, 2968, 16788, 286, 262, 4767, 6128, 12, 7081, 4097, 13, 198, 198, 1, 383, 4767, 13705, 13202, 389, 257, 1448, 286, 4273, 3650, 12, 7081, 12], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest track \" and that it is a \" Pet Shop Boys @-", "generated_result": {"0": "'\" album.

Also built into the construction contract was a provision that Zachry was charged for \" lane rentals \" by TxDOT for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on hourly assessments and the time of day the lane was closed. The fees ranged from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @,@ 000 for rush hours.

After two straight second @-@ place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside, Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside the second row. That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point. NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track. It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps, and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields. Two hours later, the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third. After Richmond's car was adjusted to remove the \" push \", the car was more to his liking. Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left. Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end. After Richmond took the lead with 30 laps left in the race, Dale Earnhardt made up three seconds on Richmond's five @-@ second lead. With four laps to go, Buddy Arrington spun in a three @-@ car accident. The remaining laps of the race where completed slowly under caution and Richmond took the checkered flag for the victory. He had led 97 laps, including the final 30, taking his first victory in a Rick Hendrick car. \n"}, {"ended": true, "tokens": [50256, 383, 4205, 4504, 284, 39375, 29941, 257, 1227, 1568, 11, 290, 16940, 31472, 329, 1194, 5373, 287, 257, 19558, 2488, 12, 31, 34464, 1785, 13, 554, 262, 2457, 807, 2488, 12, 31, 82, 12, 16, 12, 15, 12, 15, 12, 17, 25, 2488, 12, 834, 82, 12, 16, 14, 17, 12, 15, 31, 16, 834, 15, 62, 17, 31, 16, 834, 18, 25, 198, 198, 2, 2488, 12, 22955, 22955, 22955, 22955, 22955, 31, 17, 31, 12, 12404, 62, 12404, 62, 12404, 62, 31, 17, 31, 198, 198, 2, 2488, 532, 12404, 2488, 12404, 2488, 12, 12404, 2488, 12, 2488, 62, 12404, 1303, 2488, 12404, 1303, 2488, 12404, 1303, 2488, 62, 12404, 198, 27, 2, 12404, 2488, 62, 12404, 62, 12404, 31, 18, 12404, 198], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The tour returned to Pocono a month later, and Richmond battled for another victory in a fog @-@ shortened event.

Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 383, 42542, 13509, 21124, 389, 10663, 2488, 12, 31, 610, 312, 780, 484, 389, 287, 262, 10183, 6290, 9082, 286, 8598, 16069, 284, 262, 7421, 13, 1649, 13394, 1633, 422, 262, 12269, 318, 2716, 656, 18180, 11, 262, 1660, 318, 2716, 656, 262, 12269, 13, 383, 42542, 13509, 21124, 389, 407, 287, 262, 6290, 9082, 286, 12269, 284, 262, 7421, 13, 1649, 5894, 1633, 2058, 832, 262, 8598, 16069, 656, 18180, 11, 262, 1660, 15623, 656, 7850, 6341, 13, 42542, 39459, 318, 262, 691, 7850, 287, 262, 12269, 810, 262, 1660, 460, 407, 307, 2716, 416, 262, 18180, 11, 290, 262, 1660, 318, 407, 2716, 656, 18180, 416, 262, 18180, 475, 262, 15190, 13, 383, 42542, 22099, 21124, 290, 262, 42542, 5866, 21124, 389, 287, 6290, 13, 554, 5894, 1633, 11, 262, 1660, 318, 287, 262, 18180, 11, 290, 262, 15190, 11, 290, 262, 18180, 389, 407, 287, 6290, 13, 554, 5894, 1633, 11, 18180, 389, 5894, 13, 554], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The Trout Creek Mountains are semi @-@ arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west.

Narrow riparian greenways follow the year @-@ round streams. Many greenway areas have quaking aspen and willow groves. Cottonwood and alder groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is flatter and stream channels are wider. Sedges and rushes are also native to these stream bottoms. Years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species, riparian vegetation, and young aspen and willow trees. Restoration of riparian areas began in the early 1970s, and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, large wildfires in southeastern Oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range's vegetation, damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 25390, 287, 262, 42542, 13509, 21124, 389, 16573, 284, 262, 2858, 286, 262, 3334, 18692, 13, 350, 36670, 1211, 389, 2219, 287, 262, 1280, 11, 35021, 32680, 2488, 12, 31, 5017, 287, 262, 1029, 10326, 286, 3442, 13, 1119, 635, 423, 257, 1588, 3265, 286, 1402, 11, 28273, 11, 2266, 11, 290, 12768, 33039, 26697, 287, 511, 20018, 13, 1119, 389, 407, 845, 8361, 11, 484, 423, 1790, 30514, 13, 5334, 3265, 318, 1402, 290, 1402, 287, 7208, 351, 883, 286, 477, 286, 262, 584, 4693, 287, 262, 1989, 13, 1119, 389, 407, 1900, 284, 307, 8361, 393, 22414, 13, 1119, 389, 1900, 284, 307, 845, 22414, 13, 198, 198, 464, 42542, 13509, 21124, 286, 262, 1578, 2585, 286, 3442, 389, 257, 845, 1402, 8598, 2837, 290, 845, 30957, 290, 845, 4950, 13, 1119, 389, 257, 845, 4950, 1295, 287, 262, 1029, 10326, 11, 290, 262, 1029, 4447, 286, 3442, 389, 407, 845, 1588, 13, 198, 464, 42542, 13509], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Animals in the Trout Creek Mountains are adapted to the environment of the High Desert.
