With one step forward and two backward in that posture, and a jerk of the head, they completed the exotic macosa dance.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [32, 3956, 326, 5495, 2241, 416, 3624, 3891, 379, 257, 467, 550, 1282, 503, 284, 1577, 257, 3315, 9709, 220, 1682, 11, 326, 373, 262, 299, 3674, 565, 1300, 25699, 3804, 319, 284, 262, 9002, 13, 554, 1109, 340, 373, 262, 976, 530, 326, 373, 973, 379, 262, 4473, 13, 198, 818, 262, 4473, 286, 262, 1339, 339, 373, 9118, 355, 281, 28207, 706, 262, 1109, 286, 262, 4065, 475, 339, 6848, 326, 319, 262, 1110, 878, 262, 6907, 339, 550, 3750, 287, 284, 262, 4436, 284, 766, 465, 1641, 6253, 13, 679, 373, 635, 5371, 286, 257, 1218, 12, 16863, 5123, 416, 734, 6506, 287, 262, 976, 7962, 543, 547, 287, 511, 10804, 13, 198, 464, 4473, 2184, 1043, 326, 262, 9709, 286, 262, 11432, 373, 6751, 284, 38309, 683, 286, 262, 4065, 286, 717, 11, 1218, 286, 1218, 4922, 5123, 13, 198, 464, 8492, 287, 262, 1339, 319, 5198, 318, 31036, 287, 636, 290, 17687, 13, 198, 11929], "prefix_text": "A brother that introduced himself by eight names at a go had come out to give a medical testimony  actually, that was the nomenclature commentators passed on", "generated_result": {"0": " to the jury.

The General Overseer of Jesus My Lord Ministries, Pastor TunjiAdetiloye, grabbed the wireless microphone laid, for his personal use, on the stool to his left and stood up to go behind the pulpit. His two associates, sitting one to his left and the other to his right on upright chairs resembling ones at the heads of a dining table, stood up in accordance with the entrenched tradition of pre-message respect for the GO. Their Daddy-in-the-Lord progressed from his armchair to the tinted all-glass pulpit. His Bible had earlier been placed on the lectern by the armour-bearer who had proceeded to carry it from the stool on the right immediately the choir rounded off their special rendition - the cue for the message. The five-and-a-half-feet tall man of God stood on the podium and for the next two to three minutes would say nothing; his eyes roamed wild among the puzzled people. The gaze went to the choir and stayed for some troubling seconds. They were well dressed  every one female among them had something in the name of a hat to cover her head, as opposed to some members on the floor who adopted a free stance. Their music, too, had been superb right from the praises to the just concluded rendition. So, what is it? The stare left them wondering as it went 180 degrees to the Pastor's aides standing at ease on his left. Neither of them had come late for the pre-service ministers' prayer and every ministerial assignment given to them so far in the service they had carried out to the best of their abilities. Why the suspicious look? His eyes turned over to the degrees they had come to meet the bewildered gape of the floor members. What is wrong with Pastor? Hope all is well. Such was the tone of the muted conversation in the house of God. His silence was finally broken and what followed was the most unusual message they had ever had from that altar.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [6, 40, 760, 345, 1244, 423, 14028, 644, 468, 1282, 2402, 534, 38256, 13, 3363, 11, 262, 835, 314, 2900, 616, 1182, 1088, 287, 9550, 373, 8468, 290, 287, 1109, 12986, 13, 314, 373, 257, 1263, 582, 11, 290, 314, 373, 257, 1263, 582, 13, 314, 373, 257, 1862, 582, 11, 314, 373, 257, 582, 286, 617, 3297, 326, 314, 550, 587, 284, 4928, 287, 290, 314, 373, 257, 582, 286, 1793, 314, 373, 257, 22175, 11, 345, 760, 703, 314, 373, 257, 22175, 11, 262, 39797, 11, 290, 314, 531, 262, 4453, 11, 314, 716, 257, 22175, 11, 290, 314, 481, 307, 257, 5342, 11, 611, 345, 481, 13, 314, 531, 11, 314, 716, 22175, 11, 644, 314, 750, 373, 314, 1392, 257, 1310, 1643, 286, 257, 18346, 422, 262, 4453, 26, 314, 531, 340, 373, 262, 17118, 26, 314, 531, 262, 17118, 11, 644, 318, 465, 17118, 30, 314, 531, 11, 340, 318, 262, 17118, 11, 644, 318], "prefix_text": "'I know you might have wondered what has come upon your Pastor.

Up to five minutes ago I had maintained the status quo waiting for the time to preach.

The service is called short message and it should remain as such. He looked for ways of trimming down the text to one page. After reading through twice he discovered he had been too generous with spaces. He removed the space immediately after every punctuation mark and operation sign. Still the character-and-page number indicator was reading 279/2. What could he do? He removed the 'g' ending all the present participle verb forms. He abbreviated 'months' to 'mths' and 'because' to 'cos', then 'at' was transformed to its internet sign, '@', and the conjunction 'and' to its popular symbol '&'. When it would still not go for one page he finally decided to delete 'shalom' and was happy with what he saw at the corner  300/1. No wonder some of his friends called him SMS Ijebu. On several occasions he had sent texts with too many contractions. It would take the receiver several minutes of logically slotting in the missing letters for the meaning of the SMS to flow out.

Faedra often found herself imagining what it must have been like to see the heads of all those big draft horses leaning over the stall doors, before the advent of tractors had made them all redundant.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [3347, 5954, 656, 262, 1402, 1097, 3952, 326, 373, 900, 7263, 329, 262, 3096, 364, 11, 6497, 510, 262, 8278, 422, 262, 11849, 5852, 290, 45230, 503, 286, 262, 1097, 11, 4756, 257, 9294, 284, 262, 4639, 12, 1589, 3420, 13, 1081, 2582, 284, 766, 262, 3715, 314, 2497, 339, 373, 5762, 257, 4077, 10147, 287, 2166, 286, 465, 1986, 11, 257, 5166, 12, 2902, 15224, 290, 257, 5166, 37191, 13, 632, 373, 257, 3621, 1310, 2330, 10147, 11, 351, 257, 1178, 16511, 290, 257, 5166, 326, 3114, 588, 484, 547, 257, 1643, 1165, 1969, 1978, 379, 262, 16139, 13, 198, 447, 250, 15496, 11, 447, 251, 314, 531, 351, 257, 6487, 13, 632, 550, 284, 804, 517, 393, 407, 2407, 826, 284, 502, 326, 465, 4190, 11, 543, 373, 257, 1643, 1165, 890, 11, 815, 2192, 2121, 284, 663, 9016, 13, 314, 2900, 284, 262, 4639, 290, 3114, 379, 465, 1021, 12, 15266, 2657, 13, 564, 250, 1026, 4210], "prefix_text": "She pulled into the small car park that was set aside for the boarders, picked up the rose from the passenger seat and hopped out of the car, opening", "generated_result": {"0": " a bottle to the driver-side door.

Fire enabled man to predigest edible plants and grains, the more indigestible types were digested by birds and animals, which were in turn killed, cooked and eaten.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [6, 986, 867, 5207, 286, 8465, 290, 3869, 355, 2614, 393, 7402, 658, 986, 12389, 82, 290, 2566, 324, 5232, 11, 28617, 290, 22581, 5289, 11, 18588, 329, 262, 7405, 290, 9296, 11, 12389, 393, 7402, 658, 11, 290, 867, 584, 5563, 526, 679, 531, 11, 366, 40, 1053, 1239, 1775, 1997, 588, 340, 287, 616, 2104, 1204, 526, 198, 198, 1, 1858, 338, 257, 2187, 1256, 284, 307, 4499, 422, 326, 553, 531, 262, 582, 13, 366, 40, 1053, 1239, 1138, 257, 582, 508, 338, 407, 257, 1103, 582, 526, 198, 198, 1, 40, 1101, 407, 1016, 284, 1560, 262, 1621, 553, 531, 262, 582, 11, 366, 4360, 428, 318, 257, 1621, 329, 345, 526, 198, 9, 1635, 1635, 628, 220, 1635, 220, 220, 1635, 220, 314, 1101, 1016, 503, 284, 262, 1499, 284, 1011, 257, 2513, 351, 616, 3290, 329, 257, 981, 284, 651, 616, 1637, 13, 314, 1101, 1016, 284, 1011, 257, 2513, 351, 616, 4957, 11], "prefix_text": "'... many pieces of silver and gold as personal ornaments... crowns and diadems, belts and bracelets, armour for the legs and breast", "generated_result": {"0": ", crown ornaments, and many other objects.\" He said, \"I've never seen anything like it in my entire life.\"\n\n\"There's a whole lot to be learned from that,\" said the man. \"I've never met a man who's not a real man.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to tell the story,\" said the man, \"but this is a story for you.\"\n* * *\n\n  *   *  I'm going out to the country to take a walk with my dog for a while to get my money.

Their innumerable carvings of demons and dragons assumed a mournful aspect. The restless light of the flames made them seem to move. There were serpents, which seemed to be laughing, gargoyles yelping, salamanders blowing the fire, dragons sneezing amid the smoke.

As one possible approach, this virtual stockpile model could be expanded to augment WHO's ability to distribute vaccines and therapeutics to countries in the greatest need during a severe pandemic. This should also include any available experimental vaccine stockpiles for any WHO R&D Blueprint pathogens to deploy in a clinical trial during outbreaks in collaboration with CEPI, GAVI, and WHO. Other approaches could involve regional stockpiles or bi- or multinational agreements. During a catastrophic outbreak, countries may be reluctant to part with scarce medical resources. A robust international stockpile could therefore help to ensure that low and middle resource settings receive needed supplies regardless of whether they produce such supplies domestically. Countries with national supplies or domestic manufacturing capabilities should commit to donating some supply/product to this virtual stockpile.

Countries, international organizations, and global transportation companies should work together to maintain travel and trade during severe pandemics. Travel and trade are essential to the global economy as well as to national and even local economies, and they should be maintained even in the face of a pandemic. Improved decision-making, coordination, and communications between the public and private sectors, relating to risk, travel advisories, import/export restrictions, and border measures will be needed. The fear and uncertainty experienced during past outbreaks, even those limited to a national or regional level, have sometimes led to unjustified border measures, the closure of customer-facing businesses, import bans, and the cancellation of airline flights and international shipping. A particularly fast-moving and lethal pandemic could therefore result in political decisions to slow or stop movement of people and goods, potentially harming economies already vulnerable in the face of an outbreak. Ministries of Health and other government agencies should work together now with international airlines and global shipping companies to develop realistic response scenarios and start a contingency planning process with the goal of mitigating economic damage by maintaining key travel and trade routes during a large-scale pandemic. Supporting continued trade and travel in such an extreme circumstance may require the provision of enhanced disease control measures and personal protective equipment for transportation workers, government subsidies to support critical trade routes, and potentially liability protection in certain cases. International organizations including WHO, the International Air Transport Association, and the International Civil Aviation Organization should be partners in these preparedness and response efforts.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [20, 13, 8060, 1597, 815, 7564, 262, 3034, 10538, 286, 19798, 368, 873, 290, 1907, 329, 7387, 5597, 1108, 13, 554, 3090, 284, 14771, 517, 287, 10629, 511, 898, 2706, 290, 11798, 11, 6905, 815, 2074, 644, 262, 2928, 481, 307, 319, 262, 3160, 286, 511, 4409, 13, 2312, 389, 262, 5087, 749, 1593, 284, 2074, 611, 5692, 389, 284, 307, 4388, 287, 3249, 262, 2476, 329, 262, 2003, 13, 198, 198, 19, 13, 383, 761, 329, 257, 1913, 1597, 2746, 198, 198, 464, 761, 11, 290, 262, 761, 287, 262, 995, 286, 1597, 11, 815, 307, 8018, 13, 383, 761, 329, 257, 922, 290, 8245, 1664, 4645, 1276, 635, 307, 8018, 13, 198, 198, 464, 761, 329, 257, 922, 290, 8245, 9138, 290, 6082, 1080, 1276, 635, 307, 8018, 13, 317, 1913, 9138, 2858, 1276, 307, 4920, 13, 554, 867, 2678, 11, 262, 761, 329, 257, 9138, 1080, 318, 517, 8157, 621, 287, 584, 5922, 2678, 13, 632, 318], "prefix_text": "5.

We call on leaders in global business, international organizations, and national governments to launch an ambitious effort to work together to build a world better prepared for a severe pandemic.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2514, 867, 11, 2106, 3940, 257, 387, 746, 26267, 3108, 11, 284, 1728, 11, 2592, 617, 2116, 12, 562, 1522, 474, 32735, 2569, 5538, 287, 3576, 351, 257, 30889, 329, 13735, 11, 290, 284, 262, 749, 1593, 287, 257, 5270, 13, 198, 198, 1537, 329, 262, 749, 636, 11, 262, 640, 468, 4444, 880, 13, 198, 818, 1109, 11, 262, 938, 1178, 2431, 423, 587, 257, 845, 1593, 636, 290, 262, 1334, 423, 655, 587, 257, 1643, 286, 257, 1291, 86, 1754, 13, 198, 198, 1135, 447, 247, 303, 587, 612, 329, 257, 981, 11, 290, 345, 447, 240, 260, 1884, 284, 423, 257, 1178, 4201, 284, 13952, 784, 290, 257, 845, 890, 640, 284, 892, 546, 13, 314, 460, 766, 262, 640, 852, 2495, 881, 510, 284, 262, 1944, 11, 475, 314, 447, 244, 83, 1654, 326, 447, 247, 126, 99, 297, 787, 2565, 13, 198, 198, 1870, 314, 9333, 83, 447, 105, 83, 447, 105, 912, 257], "prefix_text": "To many, history followed a haphazard path, to certain, especially some self-assured jingoistic figures in London with a nostalgia for empire,", "generated_result": {"0": " and to the most important in a generation.\n\nBut for the most part, the time has ended well.\nIn fact, the last few minutes have been a very important part and the rest have just been a bit of a trawler.\n\nWe’ve been there for a while, and you‒re likely to have a few seconds to spare – and a very long time to think about.

That was evidently far from John or Anna's personal ideas. They sought something more scientific, a pattern, an overriding logic. They were not the first, some, like Spengler and Toynbee, dreamt of rationalizing history, others, from Adam Smith to Joseph Schumpeter, attempted the same thing through economics, and Peter Turchin through the rise of empires, all of which laid the foundations for the new scientific field of cliodynamics, after the Greek muse of history, Clio, and the word dynamics--force and motion. In other words the forces that drive history, and in this precise case the development of a hypothetical mathematical model to explain it.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2504, 531, 867, 20006, 290, 43310, 550, 6825, 262, 8848, 329, 257, 1271, 286, 3716, 3840, 11, 290, 12077, 606, 547, 883, 508, 7052, 284, 287, 7075, 286, 262, 3482, 34161, 262, 4576, 13318, 13, 4650, 286, 777, 547, 262, 976, 3925, 508, 7052, 7179, 287, 5472, 11, 290, 508, 547, 635, 262, 691, 3392, 287, 2031, 508, 7052, 287, 7075, 379, 262, 2276, 3071, 13, 198, 1026, 318, 407, 262, 717, 640, 326, 262, 4576, 468, 587, 23894, 329, 663, 5287, 284, 3015, 1028, 11435, 13, 554, 257, 2274, 2708, 287, 262, 4913, 288, 43054, 36, 83, 8401, 390, 300, 43054, 6310, 3678, 11, 262, 3427, 4513, 468, 1444, 329, 257, 564, 250, 34009, 290, 18039, 447, 251, 2423, 286, 262, 3427, 4479, 11, 290, 468, 635, 1444, 287, 257, 989, 319, 262, 3074, 287, 8838, 13, 198, 1722, 340, 373, 257, 2423, 286, 262, 4513, 447, 247, 82, 989, 11, 262, 4513, 550, 284, 307, 8161, 407, 284], "prefix_text": "That said many Europeans and Britons had missed the boat for a number of complex reasons, and amongst them were those who voted to in favour of the UK quitting the", "generated_result": {"0": " EU altogether.
