With one step forward and two backward in that posture, and a jerk of the head, they completed the exotic macosa dance.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [32, 3956, 326, 5495, 2241, 416, 3624, 3891, 379, 257, 467, 550, 1282, 503, 284, 1577, 257, 3315, 9709, 220, 1682, 11, 326, 373, 262, 299, 3674, 565, 1300, 25699, 3804, 319, 284, 262, 649, 5270, 286, 7519, 508, 550, 587, 8776, 416, 262, 7519, 286, 262, 1613, 13, 1119, 1444, 340, 366, 1169, 649, 6253, 526, 383, 649, 14325, 11, 1583, 13, 1757, 370, 13, 4176, 373, 257, 6253, 287, 465, 898, 1438, 13, 220, 679, 373, 257, 582, 286, 3783, 11, 257, 6253, 286, 9007, 11, 257, 6253, 286, 9007, 11, 257, 6253, 508, 561, 467, 319, 284, 1716, 262, 717, 14325, 286, 262, 2003, 13, 220, 679, 373, 262, 717, 14325, 508, 550, 587, 257, 6253, 287, 262, 1578, 2585, 286, 1605, 2106, 13, 220, 679, 373, 257, 6253, 286, 9007, 11, 257, 6253, 11, 508, 561, 467, 319, 284, 1716, 262, 717, 3315, 6253, 286, 477, 262, 995, 13, 220, 220, 383, 649, 6253, 373, 257], "prefix_text": "A brother that introduced himself by eight names at a go had come out to give a medical testimony  actually, that was the nomenclature commentators passed on", "generated_result": {"0": " to the new generation of doctors who had been trained by the doctors of the past.

The General Overseer of Jesus My Lord Ministries, Pastor TunjiAdetiloye, grabbed the wireless microphone laid, for his personal use, on the stool to his left and stood up to go behind the pulpit. His two associates, sitting one to his left and the other to his right on upright chairs resembling ones at the heads of a dining table, stood up in accordance with the entrenched tradition of pre-message respect for the GO. Their Daddy-in-the-Lord progressed from his armchair to the tinted all-glass pulpit. His Bible had earlier been placed on the lectern by the armour-bearer who had proceeded to carry it from the stool on the right immediately the choir rounded off their special rendition - the cue for the message. The five-and-a-half-feet tall man of God stood on the podium and for the next two to three minutes would say nothing; his eyes roamed wild among the puzzled people. The gaze went to the choir and stayed for some troubling seconds. They were well dressed  every one female among them had something in the name of a hat to cover her head, as opposed to some members on the floor who adopted a free stance. Their music, too, had been superb right from the praises to the just concluded rendition. So, what is it? The stare left them wondering as it went 180 degrees to the Pastor's aides standing at ease on his left. Neither of them had come late for the pre-service ministers' prayer and every ministerial assignment given to them so far in the service they had carried out to the best of their abilities. Why the suspicious look? His eyes turned over to the degrees they had come to meet the bewildered gape of the floor members. What is wrong with Pastor? Hope all is well. Such was the tone of the muted conversation in the house of God. His silence was finally broken and what followed was the most unusual message they had ever had from that altar.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [6, 40, 760, 345, 1244, 423, 14028, 644, 468, 1282, 2402, 534, 38256, 13, 3363, 11, 262, 835, 314, 2900, 616, 1182, 1088, 287, 9550, 373, 8468, 290, 287, 1109, 12986, 13, 314, 373, 407, 257, 22175, 290, 314, 373, 645, 22175, 11, 523, 314, 550, 284, 307, 262, 530, 508, 373, 612, 13, 314, 373, 262, 22175, 11, 314, 373, 262, 22175, 11, 314, 373, 262, 39797, 11, 314, 373, 262, 4928, 13, 314, 373, 262, 691, 530, 508, 2993, 644, 340, 373, 588, 13, 314, 373, 612, 284, 307, 2982, 11, 284, 766, 611, 314, 373, 1016, 284, 307, 2982, 526, 198, 198, 1, 1639, 389, 826, 553, 531, 262, 22175, 13, 366, 1537, 314, 423, 284, 467, 284, 257, 4928, 13, 314, 423, 284, 467, 284, 257, 1295, 810, 314, 460, 3285, 262, 39362, 13, 314, 423, 284, 467, 284, 257, 4928, 11, 314, 423, 284, 467, 612, 284, 3285, 262, 39362, 526, 198, 14126, 22381, 198], "prefix_text": "'I know you might have wondered what has come upon your Pastor.

The service is called short message and it should remain as such. He looked for ways of trimming down the text to one page. After reading through twice he discovered he had been too generous with spaces. He removed the space immediately after every punctuation mark and operation sign. Still the character-and-page number indicator was reading 279/2. What could he do? He removed the 'g' ending all the present participle verb forms. He abbreviated 'months' to 'mths' and 'because' to 'cos', then 'at' was transformed to its internet sign, '@', and the conjunction 'and' to its popular symbol '&'. When it would still not go for one page he finally decided to delete 'shalom' and was happy with what he saw at the corner  300/1. No wonder some of his friends called him SMS Ijebu. On several occasions he had sent texts with too many contractions. It would take the receiver several minutes of logically slotting in the missing letters for the meaning of the SMS to flow out.

Ornate stone pillars held up an archway that lined both sides of the courtyard, and even though the once lush vegetation that adorned the courtyard was now brown and lifeless, it was still impressive, even in its starkness.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [13518, 2157, 262, 29420, 11, 612, 373, 281, 9812, 4274, 3420, 13, 376, 8432, 430, 1309, 607, 2951, 27776, 2029, 262, 32439, 284, 21099, 644, 373, 3675, 340, 13, 1052, 13964, 16669, 11, 351, 257, 3236, 10580, 11, 257, 3236, 6899, 11, 257, 1049, 6899, 11, 257, 1049, 6899, 11, 257, 1049, 6899, 11, 281, 9812, 6899, 11, 290, 257, 3236, 6899, 13, 198, 198, 464, 3420, 286, 262, 16669, 373, 1280, 11, 355, 611, 340, 547, 257, 3420, 13, 383, 3420, 373, 8970, 290, 262, 3420, 373, 1280, 13, 383, 16669, 373, 6565, 13, 198, 198, 1, 2061, 389, 345, 1804, 994, 1701, 1965, 376, 3609, 293, 13, 198, 198, 1, 40, 1101, 1016, 284, 262, 16669, 553, 531, 376, 3609, 443, 12, 37, 8432, 430, 13, 198, 14126, 513, 198, 198, 464, 11312, 373, 257, 4950, 2615, 11, 257, 25023, 2615, 11, 351, 262, 1049, 6899, 286, 262, 16669, 11, 262, 1049, 24350, 286, 262, 11312, 11, 290], "prefix_text": "Further behind the fountain, there was an enormous double door.

If it was one thing she had learned in the short time she'd known them, it was that fairies could be extremely stubborn when they wanted to be.

The one hundred year long dry period between AD800 and AD1000 suggested by archaeologists, which led to the collapse of Maya civilisation and migration to the north of the Yucatan, was confirmed by paleotempestological--the study of past tropical cyclone activity, thanks to paleoclimatological and oxygen isotopes identified in sediment cores from the Great Blue Hole off the coast of Belize--the world's largest sinkhole, spanning 1,500 years.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [12130, 338, 2951, 36036, 3371, 262, 15203, 894, 69, 1678, 286, 23382, 20377, 11, 4263, 12622, 25930, 338, 662, 2144, 37765, 5761, 39388, 284, 465, 2000, 618, 2264, 292, 320, 24313, 973, 465, 898, 2939, 284, 6901, 262, 1748, 338, 47566, 13, 198, 198, 1537, 262, 2939, 373, 407, 644, 262, 4141, 1444, 366, 464, 2254, 286, 262, 10898, 553, 257, 9546, 33115, 416, 262, 4141, 23723, 11320, 347, 3885, 20190, 446, 287, 262, 2739, 7169, 82, 13, 198, 198, 464, 1748, 286, 262, 2003, 11, 347, 2143, 274, 11, 318, 257, 1748, 286, 262, 2003, 11, 257, 1748, 286, 262, 2003, 11, 257, 2003, 1748, 13, 198, 198, 464, 1748, 286, 262, 2003, 318, 262, 1748, 286, 262, 2003, 25, 198, 464, 1748, 286, 2003, 198, 198, 464, 2939, 326, 12622, 347, 3885, 20190, 1371, 973, 287, 465, 1492, 11, 383, 2254, 11, 318, 326, 286, 23382, 20377, 11, 257, 41756, 286, 23382, 20377, 11, 290, 262, 1748, 286], "prefix_text": "Pat's eyes wandered towards the twin belfries of Notre Dame, images Victor Hugo's premonitory vision sprung to his mind when Quasimodo used", "generated_result": {"0": " his own image to describe the city's skyline.\n\nBut the image was not what the French called \"The City of the Future,\" a phrase coined by the French philosopher Jean Baudrillard in the late 1980s.\n\nThe city of the future, Bruges, is a city of the future, a city of the future, a future city.\n\nThe city of the future is the city of the future:\nThe city of future\n\nThe image that Victor Baudrillards used in his book, The City, is that of Notre Dame, a cathedral of Notre Dame, and the city of"}, "prompt": "Pat's eyes wandered towards the twin belfries of Notre Dame, images Victor Hugo's premonitory vision sprung to his mind when Quasimodo used", "gen_text": "Pat's eyes wandered towards the twin belfries of Notre Dame, images Victor Hugo's premonitory vision sprung to his mind when Quasimodo used his own image to describe the city's skyline.\n\nBut the image was not what the French called \"The City of the Future,\" a phrase coined by the French philosopher Jean Baudrillard in the late 1980s.\n\nThe city of the future, Bruges, is a city of the future, a city of the future, a future city.\n\nThe city of the future is the city of the future:\nThe city of future\n\nThe image that Victor Baudrillards used in his book, The City, is that of Notre Dame, a cathedral of Notre Dame, and the city of", "reference_text": "Pat's eyes wandered towards the twin belfries of Notre Dame, images Victor Hugo's premonitory vision sprung to his mind when Quasimodo used fire and stones to save Esmeralda: 'All eyes were turned to the top of the church.

Below this flame, below the dark balustrade with its glowing trefoils, two spouts, terminating in gargoyles, vomiting un-intermittent sheets of fiery rain, whose silvery streams shone out distinctly against the gloom of the lower part of the cathedral front. As they approached the ground, these jets of liquid lead spread out into sheaves, like water pouring from the countless holes of the rose in a watering-pot. Above the flame, the huge towers, each of which showed two sides, clear and trenchant, one all black, the other all red, seemed even larger than they were, from the immensity of the shadow which they cast, reaching to the very sky. Their innumerable carvings of demons and dragons assumed a mournful aspect. The restless light of the flames made them seem to move. There were serpents, which seemed to be laughing, gargoyles yelping, salamanders blowing the fire, dragons sneezing amid the smoke. And among these monsters, thus wakened from their stony slumbers by the flame, by the noise, there was one that walked about, and moved from time to time across the fiery front of the burning pile like a bat before a candle.'\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [4863, 262, 6341, 10043, 287, 5694, 319, 9764, 9071, 5451, 1243, 3114, 3487, 11, 326, 318, 5475, 422, 262, 17625, 25849, 25016, 319, 262, 1674, 22230, 286, 262, 3331, 338, 37885, 38545, 13, 198, 198, 464, 3331, 338, 10043, 373, 257, 1402, 2615, 351, 257, 1402, 2607, 290, 257, 1402, 2607, 319, 262, 2323, 4314, 13, 198, 198, 464, 3331, 338, 10043, 373, 319, 9764, 9071, 5451, 11, 290, 262, 2607, 373, 319, 262, 2323, 4314, 286, 262, 3331, 338, 2615, 1306, 284, 663, 1388, 10043, 11, 262, 9764, 9071, 5018, 13, 198, 198, 464, 3331, 318, 257, 1402, 3331, 11, 290, 262, 2607, 318, 319, 262, 2323, 28300, 11, 543, 1724, 612, 373, 281, 2607, 319, 326, 4314, 13, 198, 198, 464, 3331, 338, 11112, 318, 257, 1402, 11, 2042, 12, 392, 2330, 11112, 351, 257, 1402, 2042, 12, 1462, 12, 11186, 3272, 12, 5657, 13, 383, 11112, 373, 3562, 329, 262, 2607, 319, 262, 2323, 4314, 286, 262], "prefix_text": "From the banks headquarters in Central on Hong Kong Island things looked normal, that is apart from the banner waving demonstrators on the forecourt of the bank's skyscraper", "generated_result": {"0": ".\n\nThe bank's headquarters was a small building with a small office and a small office on the ground floor.\n\nThe bank's headquarters was on Hong Kong Island, and the office was on the ground floor of the bank's building next to its main headquarters, the Hong Kong Bank.\n\nThe bank is a small bank, and the office is on the groundfloor, which means there was an office on that floor.\n\nThe bank's logo is a small, black-and white logo with a small black-to-white cross-bar.

A robust international stockpile could therefore help to ensure that low and middle resource settings receive needed supplies regardless of whether they produce such supplies domestically.

Improved decision-making, coordination, and communications between the public and private sectors, relating to risk, travel advisories, import/export restrictions, and border measures will be needed. The fear and uncertainty experienced during past outbreaks, even those limited to a national or regional level, have sometimes led to unjustified border measures, the closure of customer-facing businesses, import bans, and the cancellation of airline flights and international shipping. A particularly fast-moving and lethal pandemic could therefore result in political decisions to slow or stop movement of people and goods, potentially harming economies already vulnerable in the face of an outbreak. Ministries of Health and other government agencies should work together now with international airlines and global shipping companies to develop realistic response scenarios and start a contingency planning process with the goal of mitigating economic damage by maintaining key travel and trade routes during a large-scale pandemic. Supporting continued trade and travel in such an extreme circumstance may require the provision of enhanced disease control measures and personal protective equipment for transportation workers, government subsidies to support critical trade routes, and potentially liability protection in certain cases. International organizations including WHO, the International Air Transport Association, and the International Civil Aviation Organization should be partners in these preparedness and response efforts.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [20, 13, 8060, 1597, 815, 7564, 262, 3034, 10538, 286, 19798, 368, 873, 290, 1907, 329, 7387, 5597, 1108, 13, 554, 3090, 284, 14771, 517, 287, 10629, 511, 898, 2706, 290, 11798, 11, 356, 815, 307, 3910, 326, 262, 3298, 3773, 318, 3957, 290, 262, 3298, 3773, 318, 3957, 8902, 13, 198, 198, 17, 13, 383, 3298, 3773, 318, 3957, 8902, 13, 383, 3298, 1910, 318, 3957, 8902, 13, 775, 389, 4379, 517, 290, 517, 286, 262, 995, 447, 247, 82, 16533, 1663, 290, 262, 3349, 2494, 318, 3957, 8902, 287, 262, 1578, 1829, 13, 383, 1578, 1829, 318, 262, 995, 447, 247, 50, 14162, 3957, 3773, 13, 383, 3298, 3773, 318, 3957, 8902, 290, 262, 3298, 3773, 481, 1663, 8902, 287, 262, 1578, 1829, 287, 262, 1306, 1178, 4647, 11, 290, 340, 481, 307, 287, 674, 1306, 1178, 10675, 13, 198, 198, 1135, 389, 4379, 281, 2620, 287, 262, 3512, 286, 2057, 290, 584, 7017, 290, 2594, 13, 554], "prefix_text": "5.

A severe pandemic would greatly interfere with workforce health, business operations, and the movement of goods and services.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [21, 13, 4037, 5745, 815, 32980, 8868, 3034, 12751, 286, 24574, 873, 290, 19798, 368, 873, 13, 13111, 286, 262, 3034, 4419, 7186, 422, 257, 19798, 5314, 318, 1884, 284, 307, 2233, 284, 1692, 12, 17223, 393, 3288, 5087, 326, 389, 407, 22668, 9469, 416, 262, 4683, 1535, 1080, 11, 393, 262, 1535, 1080, 2346, 11, 393, 262, 1171, 1535, 1080, 2346, 13, 383, 1578, 1829, 290, 584, 2678, 815, 1011, 257, 1913, 2292, 287, 428, 1989, 13, 198, 818, 262, 1578, 1829, 11, 257, 19798, 5799, 468, 262, 6000, 2928, 319, 262, 3773, 13, 383, 1578, 1829, 468, 257, 3265, 286, 546, 352, 1510, 11, 475, 262, 2811, 3265, 318, 546, 513, 11, 830, 13, 383, 3265, 2546, 318, 635, 257, 2328, 13, 554, 257, 19798, 5799, 11, 612, 389, 257, 1271, 290, 257, 4996, 11, 475, 262, 3741, 318, 1402, 13, 383, 3265, 2546, 318, 635, 257, 5766, 13, 383, 1578, 1829, 318, 257, 1499, 351, 281, 2811], "prefix_text": "6.

In addition to other response activities, an increase in and reassessment of pandemic financial support will certainly be needed in a severe pandemic as many sectors of society may need financial support during or after a severe pandemic, including healthcare institutions, essential businesses, and national governments Furthermore, the ways in which these existing funds can now be used are limited. The International Health Regulations prioritize both minimizing public health risks and avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. But there will also be a need to identify critical nodes of the banking system and global and national economies that are too essential to fail - there are some that are likely to need emergency international financial support as well.

Governments and the private sector should assign a greater priority to developing methods to combat mis- and disinformation prior to the next pandemic response. Governments will need to partner with traditional and social media companies to research and develop nimble approaches to countering misinformation. This will require developing the ability to flood media with fast, accurate, and consistent information. Public health authorities should work with private employers and trusted community leaders such as faith leaders, to promulgate factual information to employees and citizens. Trusted, influential private-sector employers should create the capacity to readily and reliably augment public messaging, manage rumours and misinformation, and amplify credible information to support emergency public communications. National public health agencies should work in close collaboration with WHO to create the capability to rapidly develop and release consistent health messages. For their part, media companies should commit to ensuring that authoritative messages are prioritized and that false messages are suppressed including though the use of technology. Accomplishing the above goals will require collaboration among governments, international organizations and global business. If these recommendations are robustly pursued, major progress can be made to diminish the potential impact and consequences of pandemics. We call on leaders in global business, international organizations, and national governments to launch an ambitious effort to work together to build a world better prepared for a severe pandemic.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2514, 867, 11, 2106, 3940, 257, 387, 746, 26267, 3108, 11, 284, 1728, 11, 2592, 617, 2116, 12, 562, 1522, 474, 32735, 2569, 5538, 287, 3576, 351, 257, 30889, 329, 13735, 11, 290, 284, 262, 1334, 286, 262, 995, 13, 198, 32, 1178, 812, 2084, 11, 314, 373, 379, 257, 2151, 287, 262, 1748, 286, 3576, 11, 290, 257, 1178, 812, 2084, 314, 2630, 257, 1281, 319, 262, 2106, 11, 290, 262, 2106, 290, 2106, 286, 262, 3517, 8065, 13, 198, 198, 1026, 373, 257, 1049, 2589, 329, 502, 290, 262, 661, 508, 1625, 284, 3576, 284, 766, 262, 8065, 13, 632, 373, 635, 257, 1049, 1785, 329, 502, 13, 198, 464, 8065, 373, 257, 1049, 1295, 284, 307, 11, 290, 257, 1049, 1295, 284, 307, 13, 198, 198, 40, 373, 257, 845, 3772, 582, 11, 314, 716, 1654, 11, 290, 314, 373, 845, 3772, 11, 290, 314, 373, 845, 3772, 13, 198, 198, 1537, 11, 355, 257, 582, 508], "prefix_text": "To many, history followed a haphazard path, to certain, especially some self-assured jingoistic figures in London with a nostalgia for empire,", "generated_result": {"0": " and to the rest of the world.\nA few years ago, I was at a party in the city of London, and a few years ago I wrote a post on the history, and the history and history of the British Empire.\n\nIt was a great moment for me and the people who came to London to see the Empire.
