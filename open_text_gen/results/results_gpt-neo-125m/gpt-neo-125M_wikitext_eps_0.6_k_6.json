He handed over No. 224 Group to Air Vice Marshal Christopher Foxley @-@ Norris on 30 November. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 42882, 284, 4505, 11, 7123, 2543, 2627, 15110, 5953, 286, 262, 3701, 9983, 357, 6257, 1921, 1267, 319, 2608, 3269, 17672, 13, 679, 373, 9899, 257, 30653, 286, 262, 8284, 286, 9281, 3899, 13, 198, 198, 1544, 2627, 5953, 12, 1659, 3701, 9983, 286, 262, 6638, 3701, 12778, 319, 2681, 1737, 17672, 13, 679, 373, 9899, 257, 29764, 290, 257, 30653, 286, 262, 8284, 286, 4505, 290, 257, 5891, 287, 262, 8284, 286, 262, 24967, 13, 220, 2399, 3656, 11, 5335, 11, 3724, 379, 262, 2479, 286, 4019, 319, 352, 2901, 17672, 13, 220, 679, 373, 14131, 416, 465, 3367, 5613, 13, 679, 373, 14131, 635, 416, 465, 4957, 11, 5335, 13, 220, 679, 373, 14131, 416, 465, 3367, 5613, 13, 198, 464, 1708, 12784, 287, 465, 481, 357, 1129, 5333, 8, 389, 422, 465, 481, 13, 1119, 389, 422, 281, 6638, 2351, 18518, 12251, 11, 290, 389, 422, 257, 2839, 11, 1641, 12, 11990, 7964, 287, 4505, 357], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Returning to Australia, Headlam became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff ( DCAS ) on 26 January 1965.

His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II, and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term, and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in March 1966 to plan the deployment. The year before, Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co @-@ operation role when it finally did deploy. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command, Melbourne, on 8 August 1966. Support Command had been formed in 1959, by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands. On 1 January 1968, Headlam was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff. He served as an Extra Gentleman Usher to the Queen from 17 November 1970 to 5 June 1971. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 337, 2488, 12, 31, 9415, 6140, 379, 257, 35037, 351, 337, 2488, 12, 31, 7982, 290, 347, 2488, 12, 31, 9907, 7421, 286, 38433, 756, 13, 770, 35037, 318, 379, 257, 2292, 286, 546, 642, 13, 20, 10571, 2029, 262, 3641, 286, 262, 19272, 13, 383, 35037, 318, 379, 257, 966, 379, 543, 262, 734, 337, 447, 247, 17435, 286, 262, 734, 337, 17435, 389, 379, 511, 35037, 290, 262, 337, 17435, 286, 734, 347, 290, 317, 337, 17435, 13, 337, 337, 2488, 12, 16, 290, 337, 337, 2488, 12, 18, 389, 379, 262, 35037, 286, 337, 337, 2488, 16, 290, 337, 337, 2488, 19, 8148, 13, 383, 17435, 286, 347, 290, 317, 337, 17435, 319, 262, 5093, 1735, 286, 337, 2488, 16, 389, 379, 262, 35037, 286, 317, 2488, 16, 290, 347, 317, 337, 17435, 13, 383, 35037, 286, 337, 337, 2488, 17, 319, 262, 24287, 1735, 286, 428, 35037, 290, 337, 317, 337, 17435, 389, 379, 262], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> M @-@ 82 begins at a junction with M @-@ 120 and B @-@ 96 west of Fremont.

The Frank Fort designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit's famed Fisher Building. Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 46348, 468, 635, 587, 6163, 355, 262, 2003, 4067, 286, 262, 13797, 11536, 290, 11058, 3337, 357, 8779, 2943, 6739, 383, 13797, 20815, 6325, 262, 2126, 287, 5878, 290, 287, 4793, 11, 262, 1181, 15928, 3804, 25997, 807, 1828, 11, 543, 561, 1249, 13797, 284, 779, 6579, 12, 1485, 329, 262, 11536, 290, 11058, 3337, 13, 383, 1181, 561, 635, 307, 1498, 284, 779, 6579, 12, 1485, 329, 1171, 2995, 11, 1390, 28565, 287, 262, 1748, 286, 46348, 11, 290, 561, 635, 307, 3142, 284, 779, 584, 1171, 7291, 884, 355, 262, 13797, 1812, 7011, 11, 262, 1812, 2097, 286, 17132, 338, 10074, 11, 6579, 12, 1507, 4789, 286, 18864, 11, 262, 13797, 1812, 13241, 11, 290, 262, 1181, 338, 9594, 286, 3683, 13, 198, 383, 13797, 11536, 1222, 11058, 2732, 318, 257, 2888, 286, 262, 13797, 11536, 290, 8987, 4513, 543, 468, 587, 4920, 284, 2148, 2594, 284, 262, 11536, 290, 11058, 2732, 13, 383, 2732, 318], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( MAEC ).

From this bond, the Wechsler School was built in 1894, becoming the first brick public school building in the state built for blacks. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 46348, 318, 1363, 284, 734, 1281, 2488, 12, 31, 9233, 9856, 6712, 13, 46348, 8108, 5535, 11, 9393, 287, 28684, 11, 318, 5140, 379, 860, 940, 14914, 678, 399, 290, 4394, 257, 3094, 4996, 286, 3707, 3689, 290, 4056, 287, 262, 1989, 13, 383, 46348, 8108, 5535, 4394, 257, 3094, 4996, 286, 4056, 290, 2594, 13, 46348, 8108, 5535, 4394, 257, 3094, 4996, 286, 2594, 290, 4056, 11, 1390, 262, 1708, 4266, 286, 1807, 25, 198, 198, 464, 46348, 8108, 5535, 3769, 257, 3094, 4996, 286, 2594, 284, 262, 1989, 13, 383, 46348, 5535, 468, 257, 4996, 286, 4056, 290, 4056, 329, 262, 1989, 13, 383, 46348, 8108, 318, 257, 2888, 4152, 286, 13797, 1812, 11, 290, 318, 257, 17422, 2888, 286, 257, 1271, 584, 15273, 290, 42571, 1973, 477, 286, 2520, 290, 24320, 13797, 357, 8201, 11, 287, 13797, 1812, 8, 290, 262, 1578, 8741, 338, 5535, 286, 14044, 357, 2937, 45, 5222, 737, 198, 1858, 468, 587], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Meridian is home to two post @-@ secondary educational institutions.

A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location.

Three hours after classification, the depression strengthened Tropical Storm Beatriz, the second named storm of the season. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 12556, 319, 2795, 1160, 11, 24748, 596, 3220, 36841, 351, 1811, 625, 1477, 12494, 21246, 357, 2853, 5191, 416, 6279, 2488, 12, 31, 1353, 10101, 2174, 9746, 4019, 22074, 327, 357, 2488, 12, 31, 2488, 12, 31, 1353, 10101, 2029, 1343, 4019, 22074, 509, 737, 383, 6279, 21246, 547, 635, 1043, 379, 262, 1353, 290, 4220, 10101, 286, 262, 8137, 11, 355, 262, 24748, 14070, 4894, 28462, 373, 3220, 13, 383, 6279, 373, 6515, 284, 4485, 284, 1029, 5951, 379, 1343, 1795, 509, 357, 3826, 11291, 3467, 66, 737, 198, 198, 818, 1502, 284, 9161, 1771, 6279, 21246, 389, 5600, 262, 1255, 286, 24748, 14070, 16930, 11, 356, 6157, 257, 6496, 2050, 1262, 262, 976, 900, 286, 6279, 21246, 357, 6559, 313, 602, 8, 422, 262, 9285, 11, 290, 1043, 326, 11, 287, 262, 1339, 326, 262, 8137, 373, 287, 257, 24748, 14070, 1181, 11, 262, 6279, 21246, 547, 1043, 284, 307, 262, 749, 16968, 3392, 13, 383, 6279], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Early on June 20, convection increased markedly with several overshooting tops ( denoted by cloud @-@ top temperatures below − 80 ° C (", "generated_result": {"0": " @-@ @-@ top temperatures above + 80 ° K).

The party claims, to the contrary, that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 366, 19061, 366, 373, 530, 286, 262, 717, 8339, 4166, 329, 7326, 6202, 319, 257, 17349, 22343, 11, 1863, 351, 366, 12149, 3205, 366, 290, 366, 10898, 6706, 690, 27071, 632, 468, 1716, 257, 2968, 2647, 2008, 1201, 340, 373, 2727, 329, 366, 383, 4586, 17349, 1, 290, 366, 383, 5268, 3226, 383, 17349, 1911, 198, 198, 1, 198, 464, 366, 5268, 3226, 17349, 1911, 198, 464, 366, 5268, 3226, 366, 198, 464, 366, 10898, 40414, 1911, 198, 1858, 389, 867, 584, 8339, 319, 262, 17349, 22343, 11, 355, 880, 355, 262, 366, 5268, 286, 17349, 1, 290, 383, 4586, 17349, 13, 198, 198, 464, 366, 5268, 3226, 17349, 1, 290, 383, 5956, 35, 590, 198, 198, 1, 464, 5268, 366, 198, 464, 886, 286, 262, 9280, 13, 632, 318, 257, 845, 2968, 3496, 287, 262, 3482, 13, 366, 5268, 3226, 17349, 1, 318, 257, 3496, 351, 257, 845, 922, 32859, 13, 632, 318, 257, 845, 2968], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> \" Sorry \" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with \" Hung Up \" and \" Future Lovers \".", "generated_result": {"0": " It has become a popular music video since it was created for \" The Last Dance\" and \" The End Of The Dance\".\n\n\"\nThe \" End Of Dance\".\nThe \" End Of \"\nThe \" Future Lover\".\nThere are many other tracks on the Dance Floor, as well as the \" End of Dance\" and The Last Dance.\n\nThe \" End Of Dance\" and TheLastDance\n\n\"The End \"\nThe end of the dance.

Among the various remixes, the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston's \" I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) \" with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction. Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other, from the time they wrote the song \" Heart \" ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it. The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album Disco Four. Madonna's voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook.

In his first competition at the track, officials placed Richmond in the slowest heat. He passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an axle. Although he made several attempts to get the car pointed in the right direction, the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight. After being towed to the pits, he parked the car for the rest of the event. Later that season, they towed the car to Eldora Speedway, only to have Richmond crash the car again. In response, Richmond's father fired him as the driver. The next season, Al Richmond bought a SuperModified better suited to his son's driving style. In 1977 Tim Richmond became both Sandusky Speedway's Rookie of the Year and the SuperModified class track champion. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 16940, 338, 2988, 5839, 281, 18456, 26023, 1879, 24587, 290, 281, 3242, 268, 3099, 7220, 3113, 329, 262, 13521, 3234, 379, 7055, 4037, 46000, 13, 16940, 10617, 2310, 301, 14162, 14779, 706, 262, 3234, 11, 475, 262, 4639, 373, 40650, 706, 257, 15867, 5287, 13, 198, 198, 464, 16940, 26023, 9914, 4639, 373, 9951, 329, 1115, 9558, 706, 262, 3234, 13, 679, 1839, 257, 1218, 12, 5372, 3234, 287, 262, 16825, 2292, 379, 16940, 11, 290, 373, 9951, 757, 329, 262, 1306, 734, 9558, 706, 262, 3234, 290, 257, 1097, 7014, 13, 198, 198, 464, 3234, 8464, 290, 262, 16825, 12, 5372, 547, 287, 22627, 329, 262, 3670, 11, 475, 16940, 373, 5906, 284, 12780, 329, 262, 3234, 2233, 262, 7014, 13, 16940, 373, 40650, 329, 9894, 284, 1011, 262, 3234, 13, 198, 198, 49, 4092, 1700, 220, 197, 628, 36577, 6, 3891, 389, 407, 3402, 287, 45946, 1502, 13, 198, 198, 37, 12115, 20754, 198, 198, 19927], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Richmond's father bought an Eagle Indy Car chassis and an Offenhauser engine for the 1979 race at Michigan International Speedway.

Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, which was then beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17 million years ago, in the Miocene. The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land now known as the Trout Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 383, 3154, 23394, 7780, 715, 36468, 64, 318, 257, 9208, 4903, 20781, 3895, 287, 262, 42542, 13509, 21124, 13, 383, 41186, 2488, 12, 31, 14292, 2386, 1082, 64, 318, 257, 14707, 1296, 286, 262, 3881, 11, 543, 743, 307, 257, 1255, 286, 262, 3881, 338, 9807, 13, 317, 2092, 2386, 1082, 64, 318, 1043, 319, 262, 42542, 13509, 13509, 21124, 357, 14989, 13, 352, 828, 290, 318, 635, 1944, 319, 262, 42542, 13509, 22099, 11, 257, 3895, 1043, 691, 287, 428, 3814, 13, 554, 262, 42542, 13509, 22099, 262, 36468, 64, 318, 5140, 379, 262, 1353, 357, 3826, 12138, 13, 352, 737, 198, 32, 1402, 2386, 1304, 64, 318, 1043, 319, 1811, 286, 262, 42542, 13509, 22099, 357, 10962, 352, 1776, 262, 36468, 64, 318, 5140, 379, 262, 4220, 357, 11337, 604, 737, 198, 1858, 389, 257, 1271, 11, 475, 407, 477, 11, 3033, 319, 262, 13509, 290, 22099, 13, 383, 36468, 3609, 389, 635, 1944], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The broad McDermitt Caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the Trout Creek Mountains.
