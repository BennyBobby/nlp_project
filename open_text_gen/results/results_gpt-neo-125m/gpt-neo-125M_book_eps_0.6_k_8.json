With one step forward and two backward in that posture, and a jerk of the head, they completed the exotic macosa dance.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [32, 3956, 326, 5495, 2241, 416, 3624, 3891, 379, 257, 467, 550, 1282, 503, 284, 1577, 257, 3315, 9709, 220, 1682, 11, 326, 373, 262, 299, 3674, 565, 1300, 25699, 3804, 319, 284, 262, 5052, 13, 220, 220, 383, 4473, 5052, 11, 508, 635, 550, 262, 826, 220, 284, 5393, 257, 9002, 329, 262, 4007, 286, 220, 13213, 220, 1771, 262, 220, 11304, 550, 587, 9118, 393, 407, 11, 290, 220, 618, 220, 262, 220, 11304, 220, 373, 35497, 220, 286, 530, 3877, 286, 220, 262, 6907, 373, 198, 785, 16838, 11, 5081, 339, 550, 262, 826, 220, 284, 5393, 257, 220, 9002, 329, 262, 220, 4959, 329, 220, 543, 220, 428, 220, 2184, 468, 2714, 220, 287, 220, 465, 220, 4459, 13, 220, 770, 220, 220, 220, 220, 220, 220, 220, 373, 220, 1760, 220, 416, 3501, 220, 262, 220, 2184, 198, 10456, 3212, 6, 5635, 290, 220, 416, 257, 220, 3015, 13, 220, 220, 220, 220, 220, 220], "prefix_text": "A brother that introduced himself by eight names at a go had come out to give a medical testimony  actually, that was the nomenclature commentators passed on", "generated_result": {"0": " to the judge.

The General Overseer of Jesus My Lord Ministries, Pastor TunjiAdetiloye, grabbed the wireless microphone laid, for his personal use, on the stool to his left and stood up to go behind the pulpit. His two associates, sitting one to his left and the other to his right on upright chairs resembling ones at the heads of a dining table, stood up in accordance with the entrenched tradition of pre-message respect for the GO. Their Daddy-in-the-Lord progressed from his armchair to the tinted all-glass pulpit. His Bible had earlier been placed on the lectern by the armour-bearer who had proceeded to carry it from the stool on the right immediately the choir rounded off their special rendition - the cue for the message. The five-and-a-half-feet tall man of God stood on the podium and for the next two to three minutes would say nothing; his eyes roamed wild among the puzzled people. The gaze went to the choir and stayed for some troubling seconds. They were well dressed  every one female among them had something in the name of a hat to cover her head, as opposed to some members on the floor who adopted a free stance. Their music, too, had been superb right from the praises to the just concluded rendition. So, what is it? The stare left them wondering as it went 180 degrees to the Pastor's aides standing at ease on his left. Neither of them had come late for the pre-service ministers' prayer and every ministerial assignment given to them so far in the service they had carried out to the best of their abilities. Why the suspicious look? His eyes turned over to the degrees they had come to meet the bewildered gape of the floor members. What is wrong with Pastor? Hope all is well. Such was the tone of the muted conversation in the house of God. His silence was finally broken and what followed was the most unusual message they had ever had from that altar.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [6, 40, 760, 345, 1244, 423, 14028, 644, 468, 1282, 2402, 534, 38256, 13, 3363, 11, 262, 835, 314, 2900, 616, 1182, 1088, 287, 9550, 373, 8468, 290, 287, 1109, 12986, 13, 314, 373, 546, 284, 910, 11, 366, 40, 1101, 7926, 11, 616, 38256, 11, 340, 338, 407, 616, 8046, 526, 314, 3521, 126, 245, 40, 3521, 470, 1975, 428, 13, 314, 373, 546, 355, 6655, 355, 314, 373, 284, 3285, 326, 339, 373, 287, 257, 4928, 126, 245, 40, 1422, 470, 760, 1771, 428, 4001, 339, 550, 257, 1641, 393, 407, 357, 273, 611, 612, 373, 257, 1738, 339, 3521, 470, 1282, 13, 679, 373, 257, 922, 582, 11, 290, 314, 3521, 8836, 126, 224, 126, 99, 83, 1975, 340, 737, 314, 550, 262, 4203, 326, 339, 373, 257, 2089, 582, 11, 393, 379, 1551, 326, 339, 561, 307, 611, 339, 8020, 470, 587, 287, 257, 4928, 13, 632, 373, 1327, 284, 1975, 326, 314, 373, 262, 530], "prefix_text": "'I know you might have wondered what has come upon your Pastor.

Fifteen minutes was enough time to have apportioned all the responsibilities available to those present.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [464, 2968, 2610, 286, 309, 3008, 978, 17914, 11, 257, 42453, 22013, 23244, 2647, 26960, 1729, 79, 533, 346, 11, 5047, 262, 8137, 286, 262, 9927, 12, 18323, 422, 262, 4469, 11, 355, 339, 6157, 257, 3496, 287, 465, 898, 3918, 351, 645, 4419, 17300, 13, 383, 14009, 373, 3194, 284, 307, 257, 3496, 286, 262, 640, 11, 475, 262, 15844, 547, 3194, 355, 366, 464, 3496, 318, 257, 3496, 286, 616, 640, 526, 198, 198, 464, 2647, 373, 6264, 416, 978, 17914, 11, 508, 373, 635, 257, 2888, 286, 262, 42453, 22013, 23244, 10031, 2533, 47086, 5396, 13, 198, 198, 818, 262, 3095, 284, 2739, 11445, 11, 262, 4097, 373, 1444, 309, 3008, 290, 262, 3496, 338, 15844, 547, 366, 464, 3670, 373, 3194, 416, 309, 3008, 978, 8482, 11, 257, 1862, 575, 8719, 4496, 582, 11, 290, 314, 373, 1965, 284, 1702, 428, 3496, 284, 3589, 290, 284, 616, 1751, 526, 383, 3496, 373, 6264, 319, 2805, 362], "prefix_text": "The popular track of Tope Alabi, a Yoruba Gospel music performer nonpareil, charged the atmosphere of the mini-hall from the background,", "generated_result": {"0": " as he performed a song in his own style with no harmonies.

The service is called short message and it should remain as such. He looked for ways of trimming down the text to one page. After reading through twice he discovered he had been too generous with spaces. He removed the space immediately after every punctuation mark and operation sign. Still the character-and-page number indicator was reading 279/2. What could he do? He removed the 'g' ending all the present participle verb forms. He abbreviated 'months' to 'mths' and 'because' to 'cos', then 'at' was transformed to its internet sign, '@', and the conjunction 'and' to its popular symbol '&'. When it would still not go for one page he finally decided to delete 'shalom' and was happy with what he saw at the corner  300/1. No wonder some of his friends called him SMS Ijebu. On several occasions he had sent texts with too many contractions. It would take the receiver several minutes of logically slotting in the missing letters for the meaning of the SMS to flow out. He could receive a 3-page text and resend it in just one page. He had to be this generous with the text because of the recipient involved  AY.

Faedra often found herself imagining what it must have been like to see the heads of all those big draft horses leaning over the stall doors, before the advent of tractors had made them all redundant.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [3347, 5954, 656, 262, 1402, 1097, 3952, 326, 373, 900, 7263, 329, 262, 3096, 364, 11, 6497, 510, 262, 8278, 422, 262, 11849, 5852, 290, 45230, 503, 286, 262, 1097, 11, 4756, 607, 3420, 13, 198, 14126, 642, 198, 16, 14, 940, 14, 1129, 198, 198, 464, 1110, 878, 262, 10614, 11, 262, 26619, 290, 32443, 547, 5586, 287, 262, 1097, 3952, 4953, 329, 262, 26619, 286, 262, 32443, 379, 262, 7541, 13, 317, 1402, 1448, 286, 262, 26619, 12, 1462, 12, 1350, 373, 4953, 329, 262, 1097, 284, 9240, 13, 383, 26619, 12, 1462, 307, 373, 5586, 287, 607, 1097, 5852, 11, 607, 2832, 319, 607, 21497, 11, 607, 2951, 16143, 866, 379, 262, 4314, 13, 1081, 484, 10448, 673, 531, 11, 366, 2061, 338, 1016, 319, 30, 6350, 389, 345, 1701, 1375, 373, 2045, 379, 262, 4314, 351, 3094, 2951, 11, 290, 673, 373, 2045, 656, 465, 1986, 13, 383, 32443, 373, 5586, 319, 262, 4314, 11, 465], "prefix_text": "She pulled into the small car park that was set aside for the boarders, picked up the rose from the passenger seat and hopped out of the car, opening", "generated_result": {"0": " her door.\nChapter 5\n1/10/19\n\nThe day before the wedding, the bride and groom were sitting in the car park waiting for the bride of the groom at the hotel.

She felt in her heart that they knew exactly what Vivianna's motive was, but they were being tight lipped about it. If it was one thing she had learned in the short time she'd known them, it was that fairies could be extremely stubborn when they wanted to be.

Their innumerable carvings of demons and dragons assumed a mournful aspect. The restless light of the flames made them seem to move. There were serpents, which seemed to be laughing, gargoyles yelping, salamanders blowing the fire, dragons sneezing amid the smoke.

It was a good starting point for his great literary odyssey, a cosmopolitan city on the Adriatic seaboard of a soon to vanish world, that of Kafka, Stefan Zweig, Karl Kraus, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Arthur Schnitzler, and Rainer Maria Rilke, and where Freud was inventing psychiatry.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [29168, 902, 11, 3230, 5745, 11, 290, 5692, 815, 1410, 783, 329, 703, 6393, 6355, 9889, 481, 307, 21487, 1141, 257, 1588, 12, 9888, 19798, 5314, 13, 5856, 257, 6049, 19798, 5314, 11, 262, 1578, 1829, 1230, 481, 761, 281, 13029, 5339, 286, 1104, 284, 1730, 18306, 351, 262, 4902, 13, 198, 198, 464, 1578, 1829, 1230, 318, 6476, 2726, 6459, 287, 262, 1986, 286, 262, 19798, 5314, 13, 383, 1578, 1829, 1230, 468, 587, 6476, 257, 1688, 4902, 287, 262, 1578, 1829, 355, 257, 1255, 286, 262, 19798, 5314, 13, 383, 1578, 1829, 1230, 318, 6476, 2383, 7476, 287, 262, 1986, 286, 262, 26920, 615, 19397, 19798, 5314, 13, 383, 1578, 1829, 318, 262, 995, 447, 246, 264, 749, 21049, 1499, 13, 554, 3090, 284, 257, 1588, 1271, 286, 3399, 11, 340, 373, 262, 995, 447, 246, 264, 749, 8826, 1499, 13, 317, 1588, 1271, 286, 661, 290, 2628, 11, 1390, 661, 5676, 416, 262, 19798, 5314, 393, 883], "prefix_text": "Governments, international organizations, and businesses should plan now for how essential corporate capabilities will be utilized during a large-scale pandemic.

The fear and uncertainty experienced during past outbreaks, even those limited to a national or regional level, have sometimes led to unjustified border measures, the closure of customer-facing businesses, import bans, and the cancellation of airline flights and international shipping. A particularly fast-moving and lethal pandemic could therefore result in political decisions to slow or stop movement of people and goods, potentially harming economies already vulnerable in the face of an outbreak. Ministries of Health and other government agencies should work together now with international airlines and global shipping companies to develop realistic response scenarios and start a contingency planning process with the goal of mitigating economic damage by maintaining key travel and trade routes during a large-scale pandemic. Supporting continued trade and travel in such an extreme circumstance may require the provision of enhanced disease control measures and personal protective equipment for transportation workers, government subsidies to support critical trade routes, and potentially liability protection in certain cases.

Governments and the private sector should assign a greater priority to developing methods to combat mis- and disinformation prior to the next pandemic response. Governments will need to partner with traditional and social media companies to research and develop nimble approaches to countering misinformation. This will require developing the ability to flood media with fast, accurate, and consistent information. Public health authorities should work with private employers and trusted community leaders such as faith leaders, to promulgate factual information to employees and citizens. Trusted, influential private-sector employers should create the capacity to readily and reliably augment public messaging, manage rumours and misinformation, and amplify credible information to support emergency public communications. National public health agencies should work in close collaboration with WHO to create the capability to rapidly develop and release consistent health messages. For their part, media companies should commit to ensuring that authoritative messages are prioritized and that false messages are suppressed including though the use of technology. Accomplishing the above goals will require collaboration among governments, international organizations and global business. If these recommendations are robustly pursued, major progress can be made to diminish the potential impact and consequences of pandemics. We call on leaders in global business, international organizations, and national governments to launch an ambitious effort to work together to build a world better prepared for a severe pandemic.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2514, 867, 11, 2106, 3940, 257, 387, 746, 26267, 3108, 11, 284, 1728, 11, 2592, 617, 2116, 12, 562, 1522, 474, 32735, 2569, 5538, 287, 3576, 351, 257, 30889, 329, 13735, 11, 290, 284, 262, 661, 11, 508, 5615, 319, 511, 898, 13, 198, 198, 1537, 2106, 318, 257, 845, 1180, 1517, 11, 290, 340, 468, 284, 307, 5615, 287, 257, 835, 326, 318, 407, 1912, 287, 262, 1613, 13, 554, 584, 2456, 2106, 318, 257, 845, 1180, 1517, 422, 644, 340, 318, 783, 13, 632, 373, 257, 845, 1180, 1517, 422, 644, 373, 5836, 287, 4492, 13, 7443, 318, 257, 1256, 7069, 13, 632, 2753, 1295, 287, 257, 881, 517, 2276, 835, 290, 340, 318, 407, 257, 2300, 284, 1487, 340, 13, 775, 423, 284, 1487, 340, 13, 198, 198, 40, 836, 470, 892, 340, 318, 257, 2300, 284, 423, 257, 2106, 290, 257, 2106, 287, 257, 835, 326, 318, 407, 655, 546, 262, 1613, 287, 257, 835, 11], "prefix_text": "To many, history followed a haphazard path, to certain, especially some self-assured jingoistic figures in London with a nostalgia for empire,", "generated_result": {"0": " and to the people, who lived on their own.\n\nBut history is a very different thing, and it has to be lived in a way that is not based in the past.
