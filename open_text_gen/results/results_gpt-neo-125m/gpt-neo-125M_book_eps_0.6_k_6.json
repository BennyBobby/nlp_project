With one step forward and two backward in that posture, and a jerk of the head, they completed the exotic macosa dance.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [32, 3956, 326, 5495, 2241, 416, 3624, 3891, 379, 257, 467, 550, 1282, 503, 284, 1577, 257, 3315, 9709, 220, 1682, 11, 326, 373, 262, 299, 3674, 565, 1300, 25699, 3804, 319, 284, 262, 9002, 13, 628, 198, 1485, 198, 464, 9002, 2982, 262, 9709, 422, 262, 11432, 290, 422, 257, 4973, 508, 15463, 284, 340, 11, 290, 340, 373, 1598, 422, 262, 2370, 290, 262, 4578, 286, 7739, 379, 262, 1969, 286, 4473, 262, 9002, 373, 407, 9431, 286, 262, 9709, 290, 262, 9002, 550, 645, 4308, 287, 340, 284, 787, 597, 6373, 13, 383, 4473, 2184, 11, 287, 663, 3877, 284, 262, 4473, 10266, 11, 2921, 262, 1708, 12064, 319, 428, 966, 25, 198, 198, 1415, 220, 220, 366, 40, 3877, 345, 326, 262, 2370, 318, 407, 1576, 284, 4474, 262, 11304, 287, 262, 717, 290, 1218, 21164, 286, 262, 10086, 13, 220, 220, 220, 632, 318, 6751, 284, 905, 326, 262, 11304, 373, 257, 1048, 286, 262], "prefix_text": "A brother that introduced himself by eight names at a go had come out to give a medical testimony  actually, that was the nomenclature commentators passed on", "generated_result": {"0": " to the jury.\n\n\n13\nThe jury heard the testimony from the witnesses and from a witness who testified to it, and it was clear from the evidence and the argument of counsel at the close of trial the jury was not convinced of the testimony and the jury had no basis in it to make any findings.

The General Overseer of Jesus My Lord Ministries, Pastor TunjiAdetiloye, grabbed the wireless microphone laid, for his personal use, on the stool to his left and stood up to go behind the pulpit. His two associates, sitting one to his left and the other to his right on upright chairs resembling ones at the heads of a dining table, stood up in accordance with the entrenched tradition of pre-message respect for the GO. Their Daddy-in-the-Lord progressed from his armchair to the tinted all-glass pulpit. His Bible had earlier been placed on the lectern by the armour-bearer who had proceeded to carry it from the stool on the right immediately the choir rounded off their special rendition - the cue for the message. The five-and-a-half-feet tall man of God stood on the podium and for the next two to three minutes would say nothing; his eyes roamed wild among the puzzled people. The gaze went to the choir and stayed for some troubling seconds. They were well dressed  every one female among them had something in the name of a hat to cover her head, as opposed to some members on the floor who adopted a free stance. Their music, too, had been superb right from the praises to the just concluded rendition. So, what is it? The stare left them wondering as it went 180 degrees to the Pastor's aides standing at ease on his left. Neither of them had come late for the pre-service ministers' prayer and every ministerial assignment given to them so far in the service they had carried out to the best of their abilities. Why the suspicious look? His eyes turned over to the degrees they had come to meet the bewildered gape of the floor members. What is wrong with Pastor? Hope all is well. Such was the tone of the muted conversation in the house of God. His silence was finally broken and what followed was the most unusual message they had ever had from that altar.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [6, 40, 760, 345, 1244, 423, 14028, 644, 468, 1282, 2402, 534, 38256, 13, 3363, 11, 262, 835, 314, 2900, 616, 1182, 1088, 287, 9550, 373, 8468, 290, 287, 1109, 12986, 13, 314, 423, 587, 287, 262, 4928, 329, 867, 812, 475, 314, 1239, 550, 881, 284, 2193, 546, 644, 314, 716, 1804, 13, 314, 423, 257, 1256, 286, 2683, 546, 644, 318, 1016, 319, 287, 262, 28862, 475, 314, 716, 407, 1016, 6609, 11, 345, 760, 13, 632, 318, 655, 257, 2300, 286, 4917, 262, 826, 1048, 284, 466, 340, 13, 632, 318, 655, 407, 257, 922, 835, 284, 466, 262, 4928, 13, 921, 423, 645, 2126, 810, 340, 318, 1016, 13, 314, 423, 587, 1297, 326, 262, 22175, 286, 262, 4928, 318, 1016, 284, 307, 257, 1310, 1180, 621, 339, 3221, 318, 13, 679, 318, 1016, 287, 257, 1180, 4571, 621, 314, 716, 11, 290, 314, 716, 407, 257, 22175, 11, 475, 314, 716, 262, 530, 508, 318], "prefix_text": "'I know you might have wondered what has come upon your Pastor.

The service is called short message and it should remain as such. He looked for ways of trimming down the text to one page. After reading through twice he discovered he had been too generous with spaces. He removed the space immediately after every punctuation mark and operation sign. Still the character-and-page number indicator was reading 279/2. What could he do? He removed the 'g' ending all the present participle verb forms. He abbreviated 'months' to 'mths' and 'because' to 'cos', then 'at' was transformed to its internet sign, '@', and the conjunction 'and' to its popular symbol '&'. When it would still not go for one page he finally decided to delete 'shalom' and was happy with what he saw at the corner  300/1. No wonder some of his friends called him SMS Ijebu. On several occasions he had sent texts with too many contractions. It would take the receiver several minutes of logically slotting in the missing letters for the meaning of the SMS to flow out.

She shuddered at the thought that it could have turned out so differently if she hadn't been able to recover a book the fae use to control nature. The nagging reminder in the back of her mind that it had been stolen by none other than the fae king's daughter as some kind of revenge was still there. She couldn't figure out what the revenge was all about. She knew it had something to do with her, but as yet, no one, including the king, her Guardian, or her friend Jocelyn, had been forthcoming with any information whichever tact she used to try and wheedle it out of them. She felt in her heart that they knew exactly what Vivianna's motive was, but they were being tight lipped about it. If it was one thing she had learned in the short time she'd known them, it was that fairies could be extremely stubborn when they wanted to be. Well, she was a redhead with the temperament to match, and could be just as stubborn. She would find out what Vivianna's problem with her was, if it was the last thing she did. And based on the fairy princess's sword skills, it may very well be.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [464, 22467, 783, 21329, 6204, 379, 262, 1182, 286, 257, 10084, 1802, 2997, 8872, 13735, 286, 3272, 27572, 326, 965, 2860, 992, 262, 5440, 11, 5257, 4632, 416, 262, 1450, 286, 262, 22467, 508, 550, 587, 262, 749, 3665, 286, 262, 1049, 17119, 286, 262, 6156, 995, 13, 198, 198, 464, 38501, 547, 262, 749, 3665, 286, 511, 640, 784, 511, 6000, 4202, 373, 511, 30677, 625, 477, 5107, 286, 15611, 11, 1390, 262, 8429, 286, 1793, 11, 262, 8429, 12, 1659, 12, 13482, 784, 543, 373, 635, 262, 749, 3665, 286, 477, 262, 1049, 18837, 11, 351, 511, 2694, 284, 1907, 319, 1111, 5389, 286, 597, 15510, 13, 383, 22467, 373, 262, 749, 3665, 286, 477, 262, 1049, 44982, 13, 5334, 749, 3665, 17119, 561, 307, 1444, 262, 366, 34, 1381, 1911, 632, 373, 691, 618, 262, 22467, 1625, 284, 1176, 326, 340, 2627, 257, 6194, 286, 262, 1049, 17119, 290, 511, 2694, 284, 1907, 287, 597, 15510, 11], "prefix_text": "The Clan now collectively stood at the head of a diverse 100 billion dollar empire of cross holdings that straddled the planet, managed mostly by the men of the", "generated_result": {"0": " Clan who had been the most powerful of the great warriors of the ancient world.\n\nThe clans were the most powerful of their time – their greatest strength was their mastery over all forms of warfare, including the sword of God, the sword-of-God – which was also the most powerful of all the great armies, with their ability to fight on both sides of any terrain.

Fire enabled man to predigest edible plants and grains, the more indigestible types were digested by birds and animals, which were in turn killed, cooked and eaten.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [6, 986, 867, 5207, 286, 8465, 290, 3869, 355, 2614, 393, 7402, 658, 986, 12389, 82, 290, 2566, 324, 5232, 11, 28617, 290, 22581, 5289, 11, 18588, 329, 262, 7405, 290, 9296, 6816, 11, 290, 584, 3734, 5207, 286, 8465, 290, 22101, 526, 679, 2087, 11, 366, 4711, 389, 262, 691, 5207, 286, 8465, 290, 3869, 326, 314, 1053, 1683, 1775, 526, 198, 198, 464, 717, 640, 484, 547, 973, 11, 262, 717, 1048, 284, 5806, 606, 373, 257, 1862, 582, 11, 508, 531, 11, 366, 1639, 460, 470, 466, 1997, 351, 262, 10796, 526, 366, 40, 1053, 1775, 661, 5806, 606, 553, 339, 2087, 26, 366, 4360, 314, 1053, 1239, 550, 257, 10752, 287, 262, 995, 878, 2474, 198, 1, 40, 1053, 1239, 772, 587, 284, 257, 1499, 553, 262, 2933, 531, 13, 366, 40, 1053, 1239, 772, 550, 262, 3663, 284, 766, 2130, 5762, 606, 11, 772, 611, 340, 373, 287, 257, 1499, 526, 198, 464, 2933, 531], "prefix_text": "'... many pieces of silver and gold as personal ornaments... crowns and diadems, belts and bracelets, armour for the legs and breast", "generated_result": {"0": "plate, and other fine pieces of silver and bronze.\" He added, \"These are the only pieces of silver and gold that I've ever seen.\"\n\nThe first time they were used, the first person to wear them was a young man, who said, \"You can't do anything with the coins.\" \"I've seen people wear them,\" he added; \"but I've never had a coin in the world before!\"\n\"I've never even been to a country,\" the boy said. \"I've never even had the opportunity to see someone wearing them, even if it was in a country.\"\nThe boy said"}, "prompt": "'... many pieces of silver and gold as personal ornaments... crowns and diadems, belts and bracelets, armour for the legs and breast", "gen_text": "'... many pieces of silver and gold as personal ornaments... crowns and diadems, belts and bracelets, armour for the legs and breastplate, and other fine pieces of silver and bronze.\" He added, \"These are the only pieces of silver and gold that I've ever seen.\"\n\nThe first time they were used, the first person to wear them was a young man, who said, \"You can't do anything with the coins.\" \"I've seen people wear them,\" he added; \"but I've never had a coin in the world before!\"\n\"I've never even been to a country,\" the boy said. \"I've never even had the opportunity to see someone wearing them, even if it was in a country.\"\nThe boy said", "reference_text": "'... many pieces of silver and gold as personal ornaments ... crowns and diadems, belts and bracelets, armour for the legs and breastplates; tweezers and rattles and strings and clusters of beads and rubies, mirrors decorated with silver, and cups and other drinking vessels.

The World Health Organization (WHO) currently has an influenza vaccine virtual stockpile, with contracts in place with pharmaceutical companies that have agreed to supply vaccines should WHO request them. As one possible approach, this virtual stockpile model could be expanded to augment WHO's ability to distribute vaccines and therapeutics to countries in the greatest need during a severe pandemic. This should also include any available experimental vaccine stockpiles for any WHO R&D Blueprint pathogens to deploy in a clinical trial during outbreaks in collaboration with CEPI, GAVI, and WHO. Other approaches could involve regional stockpiles or bi- or multinational agreements. During a catastrophic outbreak, countries may be reluctant to part with scarce medical resources.

Countries, international organizations, and global transportation companies should work together to maintain travel and trade during severe pandemics. Travel and trade are essential to the global economy as well as to national and even local economies, and they should be maintained even in the face of a pandemic. Improved decision-making, coordination, and communications between the public and private sectors, relating to risk, travel advisories, import/export restrictions, and border measures will be needed. The fear and uncertainty experienced during past outbreaks, even those limited to a national or regional level, have sometimes led to unjustified border measures, the closure of customer-facing businesses, import bans, and the cancellation of airline flights and international shipping. A particularly fast-moving and lethal pandemic could therefore result in political decisions to slow or stop movement of people and goods, potentially harming economies already vulnerable in the face of an outbreak. Ministries of Health and other government agencies should work together now with international airlines and global shipping companies to develop realistic response scenarios and start a contingency planning process with the goal of mitigating economic damage by maintaining key travel and trade routes during a large-scale pandemic. Supporting continued trade and travel in such an extreme circumstance may require the provision of enhanced disease control measures and personal protective equipment for transportation workers, government subsidies to support critical trade routes, and potentially liability protection in certain cases. International organizations including WHO, the International Air Transport Association, and the International Civil Aviation Organization should be partners in these preparedness and response efforts.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [20, 13, 8060, 1597, 815, 7564, 262, 3034, 10538, 286, 19798, 368, 873, 290, 1907, 329, 7387, 5597, 1108, 13, 554, 3090, 284, 14771, 517, 287, 10629, 511, 898, 2706, 290, 11798, 11, 356, 481, 635, 670, 3371, 262, 7741, 286, 262, 1271, 286, 661, 287, 262, 16433, 284, 4646, 262, 1271, 326, 484, 389, 1498, 284, 670, 287, 13, 554, 1502, 284, 466, 326, 290, 284, 4646, 262, 1271, 286, 661, 287, 262, 1499, 11, 356, 1276, 635, 1011, 656, 1848, 257, 1271, 286, 584, 5087, 326, 2689, 262, 3773, 13, 198, 464, 1708, 389, 617, 286, 262, 5087, 326, 2689, 262, 1271, 286, 661, 287, 1123, 6567, 25, 198, 198, 9129, 383, 1271, 286, 661, 508, 670, 287, 1180, 16020, 13, 198, 3581, 464, 1271, 286, 3925, 1762, 379, 1180, 2974, 286, 3739, 13, 198, 3581, 464, 1241, 286, 3707, 11, 3739, 11, 290, 5129, 13, 770, 481, 2689, 661, 447, 240, 12519, 13, 632, 318, 1593, 326], "prefix_text": "5.

In other words the forces that drive history, and in this precise case the development of a hypothetical mathematical model to explain it.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2504, 531, 867, 20006, 290, 43310, 550, 6825, 262, 8848, 329, 257, 1271, 286, 3716, 3840, 11, 290, 12077, 606, 547, 883, 508, 7052, 284, 287, 7075, 286, 262, 3482, 34161, 262, 4576, 13318, 13, 198, 198, 464, 3482, 373, 530, 286, 262, 938, 2678, 284, 423, 257, 11467, 319, 5491, 5033, 257, 1479, 1910, 11, 290, 262, 3482, 318, 530, 286, 262, 1178, 326, 468, 257, 3741, 319, 262, 11100, 13, 198, 198, 1537, 428, 857, 407, 1612, 326, 11435, 318, 257, 2089, 1517, 284, 1645, 287, 262, 1790, 3381, 13, 198, 5569, 262, 2708, 198, 58, 5569, 517, 60, 685, 5167, 22345, 198, 198, 464, 8283, 468, 2098, 703, 11435, 468, 587, 257, 564, 251, 40878, 7457, 447, 251, 11, 290, 468, 587, 3417, 355, 281, 564, 250, 1040, 1531, 447, 251, 1445, 284, 564, 250, 417, 320, 4559, 262, 2928, 11435, 318, 1719, 290, 284, 787, 262, 1429, 881, 18599, 290, 37063, 447, 251, 11, 355, 880], "prefix_text": "That said many Europeans and Britons had missed the boat for a number of complex reasons, and amongst them were those who voted to in favour of the UK quitting the", "generated_result": {"0": " EU altogether.\n\nThe UK was one of the last countries to have a referendum on Britain becoming a free market, and the UK is one of the few that has a majority on the ballot.\n\nBut this does not mean that Brexit is a bad thing to happen in the short term.\nRead the article\n[Read more] [More...]\n\nThe Guardian has reported how Brexit has been a ”huge mistake”, and has been described as an “insane” move to “eliminate the impact Brexit is having and to make the process much simpler and faire”, as well"}, "prompt": "That said many Europeans and Britons had missed the boat for a number of complex reasons, and amongst them were those who voted to in favour of the UK quitting the", "gen_text": "That said many Europeans and Britons had missed the boat for a number of complex reasons, and amongst them were those who voted to in favour of the UK quitting the EU altogether.\n\nThe UK was one of the last countries to have a referendum on Britain becoming a free market, and the UK is one of the few that has a majority on the ballot.\n\nBut this does not mean that Brexit is a bad thing to happen in the short term.\nRead the article\n[Read more] [More...]\n\nThe Guardian has reported how Brexit has been a ”huge mistake”, and has been described as an “insane” move to “eliminate the impact Brexit is having and to make the process much simpler and faire”, as well", "reference_text": "That said many Europeans and Britons had missed the boat for a number of complex reasons, and amongst them were those who voted to in favour of the UK quitting the EU, including factory workers, pensioners and those nostalgic for a past, which if examined was much grubbier, as Pat Wolfe knew, he'd lived in those days, in soot begrimed smoggy London, in a class ridden society where few, very few, working class kids ever got to university, where continental holidays were reserved for the privileged, where news was broadcast by a small number of radio and TV channels, where hundreds of thousands of men worked in coal mines, where few working class families owned cars.
