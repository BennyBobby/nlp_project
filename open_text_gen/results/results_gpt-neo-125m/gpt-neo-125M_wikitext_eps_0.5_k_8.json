His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II, and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term, and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in March 1966 to plan the deployment. The year before, Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co @-@ operation role when it finally did deploy. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command, Melbourne, on 8 August 1966. Support Command had been formed in 1959, by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands.

Architecture students from around the nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their coursework due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects. The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born Architect Louis S. Curtiss, famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper, is extant on Highland Park. The Frank Fort designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit's famed Fisher Building. Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills. \n"}, {"ended": true, "tokens": [50256, 46348, 468, 635, 587, 6163, 355, 262, 2003, 4067, 286, 262, 13797, 11536, 290, 11058, 3337, 357, 8779, 2943, 6739, 383, 13797, 20815, 6325, 262, 2126, 287, 5878, 290, 287, 4793, 6325, 340, 287, 1502, 326, 262, 1181, 815, 2251, 257, 649, 4067, 329, 663, 11536, 3337, 290, 284, 307, 1280, 422, 262, 3726, 286, 2901, 284, 2693, 1123, 614, 290, 329, 262, 1334, 286, 2901, 284, 2693, 355, 262, 1181, 338, 717, 4067, 329, 13797, 338, 11536, 13, 383, 4067, 318, 3058, 852, 9456, 416, 262, 2732, 338, 4452, 286, 23897, 10665, 13, 198, 198, 45533, 661, 198, 198, 45533, 661, 351, 262, 1708, 4082, 3307, 2291, 25, 1058, 198, 198, 45533, 661, 1231, 597, 4082, 393, 1641, 2888, 2291, 11, 355, 286, 2177, 11, 25], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( MAEC ).

A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location.

In light of this, the National Hurricane Center estimated Beatriz to have attained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) along with a barometric pressure of 977 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 85 inHg ) ; however, it was noted that this could be conservative based on estimates of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) from the University of Wisconsin and the Satellite Analysis Branch. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 24581, 262, 3329, 286, 2795, 2310, 11, 12568, 47847, 31782, 262, 7051, 286, 5828, 11, 351, 262, 3641, 6427, 7323, 1315, 21504, 357, 1160, 10571, 1267, 5366, 2488, 12, 31, 26015, 286, 262, 3139, 11, 290, 262, 3641, 286, 262, 1748, 2488, 12, 31, 5366, 286, 2986, 16852, 11, 290, 262, 3641, 6427, 7323, 1105, 25, 1238, 21504, 13841, 1314, 21504, 1267, 5366, 2488, 12, 31, 5366, 286, 2986, 29825, 287, 8372, 5828, 13, 198, 198, 464, 1388, 2975, 284, 290, 5366, 284, 2574, 39245, 290, 262, 1748, 286, 2574, 7298, 2879, 287, 7840, 5828, 318, 262, 350, 589, 418, 390, 5401, 5652, 11, 262, 350, 1386, 290, 584, 3354, 286, 428, 1748, 11, 290, 318, 7498, 355, 257, 636, 290, 281, 7552, 286, 2574, 327, 1228, 18840, 13, 198, 32, 1178, 2250, 1568, 262, 1097, 9911, 379, 350, 589, 418, 11, 351, 262, 1388, 1627, 286, 2574, 327, 5669, 418, 290, 262, 350, 2367, 13, 198, 1858, 547, 645], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Throughout the morning of June 21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15 mi ( 20 km ) south @-@ southeast", "generated_result": {"0": " of the capital, and the center of the city @-@ south of San Juan, and the center passing roughly 12:20 mi (-15 mi ) south @-@ south of San Miguel in southern Mexico.\n\nThe main road to and south to El Paso and the city of El Camino in northern Mexico is the Paseos de Los Angeles, the Pases and other parts of this city, and is marked as a part and an extension of El Cajón.\nA few hours later the car stops at Paseos, with the main line of El Caminos and the Pades.\nThere were no"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> Throughout the morning of June 21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15 mi ( 20 km ) south @-@ southeast", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> Throughout the morning of June 21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15 mi ( 20 km ) south @-@ southeast of the capital, and the center of the city @-@ south of San Juan, and the center passing roughly 12:20 mi (-15 mi ) south @-@ south of San Miguel in southern Mexico.\n\nThe main road to and south to El Paso and the city of El Camino in northern Mexico is the Paseos de Los Angeles, the Pases and other parts of this city, and is marked as a part and an extension of El Cajón.\nA few hours later the car stops at Paseos, with the main line of El Caminos and the Pades.\nThere were no", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> Throughout the morning of June 21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15 mi ( 20 km ) south @-@ southeast of La Fortuna, Mexico.

It then changes to Fm – Gm @-@ Cm in the chorus, while continuing in A ♭ – Cm – A ♭ – Fm in the intermediate verses, ultimately ending in repeated lines of \" I've heard it all before \". \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 406, 2417, 1146, 262, 3496, 468, 39146, 286, 1180, 8950, 1390, 4141, 11, 7897, 11, 8200, 11, 10914, 11, 16505, 11, 43443, 11, 15945, 290, 4960, 13, 383, 3496, 6130, 546, 262, 6817, 287, 262, 1204, 286, 674, 18668, 286, 262, 717, 5270, 286, 262, 1692, 3234, 13, 1081, 257, 2888, 286, 262, 2679, 12, 25159, 9137, 11, 314, 716, 845, 21014, 287, 262, 3496, 284, 3328, 262, 5764, 13, 198, 198, 1212, 2708, 318, 257, 8319, 1281, 13, 383, 1772, 318, 407, 3917, 284, 11, 4249, 857, 339, 11438, 11, 597, 286, 262, 7035, 286, 428, 2708, 13, 198, 198, 464, 5764, 318, 5545, 284, 502, 416, 262, 2679, 12, 25159, 9137, 13, 554, 262, 1613, 356, 423, 2982, 546, 428, 5764, 329, 262, 976, 1738, 13, 887, 783, 314, 561, 588, 284, 2648, 617, 286, 663, 10154, 284, 1577, 617, 4732, 290, 284, 1577, 617, 6650, 284, 703, 777, 13304, 460, 307, 2722, 13, 198, 198, 40], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Lyrically the song has excerpts of different languages including French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Hebrew, Hindi, Polish and Japanese.

Among the various remixes, the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston's \" I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) \" with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction. Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other, from the time they wrote the song \" Heart \" ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it. The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album Disco Four. Madonna's voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook. A breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends, leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 16348, 28879, 9413, 286, 31214, 3000, 2630, 326, 366, 19061, 366, 318, 262, 366, 5062, 338, 12841, 2610, 366, 290, 326, 340, 318, 257, 366, 4767, 13705, 17528, 2488, 12, 16, 1, 3496, 13, 198, 198, 1, 24018, 25803, 1, 318, 257, 3496, 351, 257, 366, 4767, 1, 7505, 13, 632, 318, 366, 257, 845, 922, 3496, 351, 617, 922, 15844, 13, 366, 366, 468, 366, 366, 257, 366, 4767, 1, 7505, 13, 366, 366, 318, 257, 366, 4767, 13, 366, 318, 635, 257, 366, 4273, 1106, 632, 318, 257, 3496, 351, 922, 15844, 366, 366, 318, 922, 13, 366, 4767, 1, 318, 635, 257, 4767, 366, 532, 16, 1, 3496, 326, 373, 8096, 319, 383, 18319, 18319, 2080, 5180, 4373, 338, 649, 5062, 290, 318, 783, 1695, 329, 5001, 832, 262, 7849, 9363, 1106, 366, 383, 18319, 18319, 2080, 705, 6449, 1, 318, 257, 4273, 1106, 366], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest track \" and that it is a \" Pet Shop Boys @-", "generated_result": {"0": "1\" song.\n\n\" \"'Pet\" is a song with a \" Pet\" theme.

Also built into the construction contract was a provision that Zachry was charged for \" lane rentals \" by TxDOT for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on hourly assessments and the time of day the lane was closed. The fees ranged from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @,@ 000 for rush hours.

Then every time anyone congratulated me, I started bawling again. \" Richmond earned a victory in the next race at Riverside, and made his final 1987 start at Michigan International Speedway's Champion Spark Plug 400 that August, finishing 29th with a blown engine. He resigned from Hendrick Motorsports in September 1987. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 554, 6303, 11, 257, 1178, 1933, 706, 16940, 338, 1918, 11, 2669, 5581, 4429, 370, 41, 13534, 2488, 12, 31, 3195, 290, 9095, 5199, 64, 347, 2093, 259, 2098, 326, 257, 366, 69, 415, 3477, 1448, 379, 262, 2635, 11312, 1, 373, 2950, 379, 262, 640, 287, 262, 366, 403, 37850, 5917, 1, 326, 2957, 284, 607, 1918, 287, 3389, 10249, 26, 428, 373, 3940, 416, 281, 3645, 416, 9716, 3000, 290, 262, 2669, 2947, 13, 198, 198, 2202, 1737, 1248, 11, 9768, 30051, 3000, 3199, 257, 989, 319, 644, 340, 1444, 11, 1864, 284, 543, 366, 1169, 2635, 11312, 1, 357, 1169, 2669, 2947, 11, 9716, 3000, 11, 262, 2669, 360, 13, 34, 7874, 2256, 42508, 1705, 4009, 290, 262, 2669, 2947, 8, 318, 366, 1169, 691, 3127, 286, 663, 28139, 526, 220, 4784, 663, 3052, 340, 338, 262, 4387, 1705, 3127, 287, 262, 1499, 351, 517, 3923, 11, 355, 880, 355, 663, 749, 12, 961, 11], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> In 1990, a few months after Richmond's death, Washington television station WJLA @-@ TV and reporter Roberta Baskin reported that", "generated_result": {"0": " a \"fantastic group at the White Castle\" was involved at the time in the \"unusual circumstances\" that led to her death in November 1991; this was followed by an investigation by NBC News and the Washington Post.\n\nOn May 18, 1992 PBS News published a report on what it called, according to which \"the White Castle\" (the Washington Post, NBC News, the Washington D.C.-headquartered news organization and the Washington Post) is \"the only network of its caliber.\"  According its website it's the largest news network in the country with more stories, as well as its most-read,"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> In 1990, a few months after Richmond's death, Washington television station WJLA @-@ TV and reporter Roberta Baskin reported that", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> In 1990, a few months after Richmond's death, Washington television station WJLA @-@ TV and reporter Roberta Baskin reported that a \"fantastic group at the White Castle\" was involved at the time in the \"unusual circumstances\" that led to her death in November 1991; this was followed by an investigation by NBC News and the Washington Post.\n\nOn May 18, 1992 PBS News published a report on what it called, according to which \"the White Castle\" (the Washington Post, NBC News, the Washington D.C.-headquartered news organization and the Washington Post) is \"the only network of its caliber.\"  According its website it's the largest news network in the country with more stories, as well as its most-read,", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> In 1990, a few months after Richmond's death, Washington television station WJLA @-@ TV and reporter Roberta Baskin reported that Dr. Forest Tennant, who was then the National Football League's drug adviser, \" falsified drug tests \" that ultimately helped shorten Richmond's NASCAR career.

Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 383, 42542, 13509, 21124, 389, 10663, 2488, 12, 31, 610, 312, 780, 484, 389, 287, 262, 10183, 6290, 9082, 286, 8598, 16069, 284, 262, 7421, 13, 1649, 13394, 1633, 422, 262, 5093, 12229, 262, 12269, 287, 511, 7374, 11, 340, 318, 3221, 287, 262, 1296, 286, 257, 6546, 4020, 13, 554, 262, 3931, 612, 318, 257, 6546, 42772, 286, 6729, 13, 383, 6729, 468, 257, 13542, 284, 1716, 29175, 287, 262, 2739, 3931, 290, 23608, 13, 383, 6290, 318, 4143, 407, 845, 1913, 11, 355, 612, 318, 257, 7888, 18447, 286, 19558, 13, 198, 198, 464, 42542, 21124, 198, 1906, 198, 464, 5866, 42542, 13509, 357, 14508, 6412, 4175, 453, 564, 250, 1169, 42542, 960, 8, 318, 257, 256, 2455, 652, 286, 383, 43956, 13667, 287, 262, 1578, 1829, 13, 632, 318, 281, 1280, 7850, 326, 4539, 1022, 262, 12269, 290, 262, 7850, 13, 198, 198, 464, 42542, 9638, 13667, 198, 1906, 198, 1212, 318, 810, 49411, 389], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The Trout Creek Mountains are semi @-@ arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west.

However, these areas are vital to the local ecosystem. The meadows surround springs, which are mostly on gently sloping uplands or in stream bottoms, and range in size from about 1 to 5 acres ( 0 @.@ 40 to 2 @.@ 02 ha ). Narrow riparian greenways follow the year @-@ round streams. Many greenway areas have quaking aspen and willow groves. Cottonwood and alder groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is flatter and stream channels are wider. Sedges and rushes are also native to these stream bottoms. Years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species, riparian vegetation, and young aspen and willow trees. Restoration of riparian areas began in the early 1970s, and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, large wildfires in southeastern Oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range's vegetation, damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 25390, 287, 262, 42542, 13509, 21124, 389, 16573, 284, 262, 2858, 286, 262, 3334, 18692, 13, 350, 36670, 1211, 389, 2219, 287, 262, 1280, 11, 35021, 32680, 2488, 12, 31, 5017, 12, 929, 12, 1169, 12, 69, 433, 372, 12, 1014, 12, 1659, 31, 262, 1877, 1044, 11, 35021, 290, 27268, 13, 1119, 389, 16573, 287, 262, 1280, 13, 48657, 418, 547, 5495, 656, 3340, 546, 1248, 812, 3161, 284, 262, 1944, 14250, 13, 1119, 547, 5495, 355, 257, 4693, 287, 546, 1248, 2327, 13, 383, 279, 7944, 273, 1505, 318, 845, 1877, 287, 1271, 13, 1119, 2837, 546, 352, 14, 17, 284, 718, 14, 18, 11, 262, 2546, 286, 749, 6134, 13, 1119, 389, 16573, 284, 1111, 1029, 290, 1877, 20334, 13, 1318, 373, 257, 1049, 1730, 546, 279, 342, 287, 3340, 11, 290, 612, 373, 645, 835, 326, 484, 460, 307, 973, 287, 326, 835, 13, 198, 47, 13, 599, 13, 357, 36, 380, 2522, 273], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Animals in the Trout Creek Mountains are adapted to the environment of the High Desert.
