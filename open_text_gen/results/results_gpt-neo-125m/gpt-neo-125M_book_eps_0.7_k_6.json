With one step forward and two backward in that posture, and a jerk of the head, they completed the exotic macosa dance.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [32, 3956, 326, 5495, 2241, 416, 3624, 3891, 379, 257, 467, 550, 1282, 503, 284, 1577, 257, 3315, 9709, 220, 1682, 11, 326, 373, 262, 299, 3674, 565, 1300, 25699, 3804, 319, 284, 262, 9002, 13, 679, 373, 257, 582, 286, 1049, 2694, 11, 508, 550, 1239, 587, 257, 14325, 290, 550, 1464, 587, 257, 2888, 286, 262, 3315, 7573, 13, 679, 373, 407, 257, 3315, 6253, 11, 475, 257, 14325, 338, 14325, 13, 220, 198, 198, 464, 9002, 11, 287, 262, 886, 11, 373, 9086, 656, 2237, 2628, 11, 1123, 13160, 5000, 286, 661, 508, 550, 587, 1866, 286, 262, 3315, 34423, 329, 257, 890, 1576, 2278, 286, 640, 284, 423, 587, 1866, 379, 617, 966, 1141, 326, 640, 13, 383, 9002, 373, 9086, 656, 2237, 3354, 11, 477, 286, 543, 547, 262, 976, 13, 383, 28792, 547, 9086, 656, 734, 2628, 11, 262, 717, 1448, 852, 13160, 9944, 286, 1450, 508, 714, 407, 307, 1866, 11, 290, 11], "prefix_text": "A brother that introduced himself by eight names at a go had come out to give a medical testimony  actually, that was the nomenclature commentators passed on", "generated_result": {"0": " to the jury.

The General Overseer of Jesus My Lord Ministries, Pastor TunjiAdetiloye, grabbed the wireless microphone laid, for his personal use, on the stool to his left and stood up to go behind the pulpit. His two associates, sitting one to his left and the other to his right on upright chairs resembling ones at the heads of a dining table, stood up in accordance with the entrenched tradition of pre-message respect for the GO. Their Daddy-in-the-Lord progressed from his armchair to the tinted all-glass pulpit. His Bible had earlier been placed on the lectern by the armour-bearer who had proceeded to carry it from the stool on the right immediately the choir rounded off their special rendition - the cue for the message. The five-and-a-half-feet tall man of God stood on the podium and for the next two to three minutes would say nothing; his eyes roamed wild among the puzzled people. The gaze went to the choir and stayed for some troubling seconds. They were well dressed  every one female among them had something in the name of a hat to cover her head, as opposed to some members on the floor who adopted a free stance. Their music, too, had been superb right from the praises to the just concluded rendition. So, what is it? The stare left them wondering as it went 180 degrees to the Pastor's aides standing at ease on his left. Neither of them had come late for the pre-service ministers' prayer and every ministerial assignment given to them so far in the service they had carried out to the best of their abilities. Why the suspicious look? His eyes turned over to the degrees they had come to meet the bewildered gape of the floor members. What is wrong with Pastor? Hope all is well. Such was the tone of the muted conversation in the house of God. His silence was finally broken and what followed was the most unusual message they had ever had from that altar.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [6, 40, 760, 345, 1244, 423, 14028, 644, 468, 1282, 2402, 534, 38256, 13, 3363, 11, 262, 835, 314, 2900, 616, 1182, 1088, 287, 9550, 373, 8468, 290, 287, 1109, 12986, 13, 314, 373, 257, 1310, 6655, 11, 475, 314, 373, 635, 845, 6655, 326, 262, 38256, 286, 534, 4928, 373, 407, 257, 582, 286, 1793, 13, 198, 198, 40, 373, 257, 1643, 6655, 326, 262, 38256, 550, 407, 587, 1498, 284, 2740, 284, 502, 878, 339, 1364, 262, 28862, 13, 314, 373, 2407, 6655, 326, 339, 550, 407, 587, 1498, 287, 617, 835, 284, 651, 284, 502, 13, 314, 373, 635, 6655, 326, 339, 550, 407, 587, 1498, 284, 651, 284, 345, 13, 679, 550, 587, 845, 1611, 290, 7613, 13, 198, 198, 40, 373, 845, 11472, 326, 339, 550, 407, 587, 284, 502, 878, 339, 1816, 1497, 13, 632, 373, 845, 2408, 284, 1064, 257, 4928, 326, 561, 407, 307, 1498, 284, 1037, 345, 13, 314, 373, 845], "prefix_text": "'I know you might have wondered what has come upon your Pastor.

Up to five minutes ago I had maintained the status quo waiting for the time to preach.

The service is called short message and it should remain as such. He looked for ways of trimming down the text to one page. After reading through twice he discovered he had been too generous with spaces. He removed the space immediately after every punctuation mark and operation sign. Still the character-and-page number indicator was reading 279/2. What could he do? He removed the 'g' ending all the present participle verb forms. He abbreviated 'months' to 'mths' and 'because' to 'cos', then 'at' was transformed to its internet sign, '@', and the conjunction 'and' to its popular symbol '&'. When it would still not go for one page he finally decided to delete 'shalom' and was happy with what he saw at the corner  300/1. No wonder some of his friends called him SMS Ijebu. On several occasions he had sent texts with too many contractions. It would take the receiver several minutes of logically slotting in the missing letters for the meaning of the SMS to flow out.

She felt in her heart that they knew exactly what Vivianna's motive was, but they were being tight lipped about it. If it was one thing she had learned in the short time she'd known them, it was that fairies could be extremely stubborn when they wanted to be.

As they approached the ground, these jets of liquid lead spread out into sheaves, like water pouring from the countless holes of the rose in a watering-pot. Above the flame, the huge towers, each of which showed two sides, clear and trenchant, one all black, the other all red, seemed even larger than they were, from the immensity of the shadow which they cast, reaching to the very sky. Their innumerable carvings of demons and dragons assumed a mournful aspect. The restless light of the flames made them seem to move. There were serpents, which seemed to be laughing, gargoyles yelping, salamanders blowing the fire, dragons sneezing amid the smoke. And among these monsters, thus wakened from their stony slumbers by the flame, by the noise, there was one that walked about, and moved from time to time across the fiery front of the burning pile like a bat before a candle.'\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [4863, 262, 6341, 10043, 287, 5694, 319, 9764, 9071, 5451, 1243, 3114, 3487, 11, 326, 318, 5475, 422, 262, 17625, 25849, 25016, 319, 262, 1674, 22230, 286, 262, 3331, 338, 37885, 38545, 12, 16894, 11, 262, 9764, 74, 506, 8765, 287, 262, 7372, 12, 8534, 286, 262, 6616, 13, 198, 198, 464, 9764, 80, 278, 5018, 373, 257, 1402, 11, 1402, 11, 1402, 3331, 11, 351, 691, 257, 1178, 3470, 4409, 11, 262, 9764, 80, 278, 5018, 373, 257, 1402, 11, 1310, 3331, 11, 290, 340, 373, 257, 1402, 1597, 13, 1119, 1422, 447, 247, 83, 772, 423, 257, 3331, 1848, 11, 484, 550, 645, 3331, 4116, 11, 484, 655, 550, 511, 898, 3331, 11, 290, 484, 550, 257, 3331, 1848, 13, 198, 198, 464, 9764, 80, 278, 5018, 373, 655, 257, 1402, 11, 1402, 11, 1402, 3331, 11, 351, 691, 617, 286, 262, 1664, 447, 247, 82, 4409, 11, 475, 484, 550, 257, 3331, 290, 257, 3331, 1848, 351], "prefix_text": "From the banks headquarters in Central on Hong Kong Island things looked normal, that is apart from the banner waving demonstrators on the forecourt of the bank's skyscraper", "generated_result": {"0": "-building, the Hongkong Tower in the centre-front of the square.\n\nThe Hongqing Bank was a small, small, small bank, with only a few hundred employees, the Hongqing Bank was a small, little bank, and it was a small business.

There he worked his way up the hard way, step by step, to the commercial-banking business, much of that time in Asia, until he arrived at the summit of the unit in Hong Kong in late 2015--not long after Pat Kennedy commenced his own fulgurant accession to the top of INI.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [6, 40, 2497, 262, 2187, 685, 22030, 4479, 60, 1487, 13, 632, 373, 257, 7932, 640, 284, 307, 612, 13, 383, 11307, 5007, 3214, 290, 262, 4141, 290, 16064, 550, 284, 5409, 644, 284, 466, 1306, 13, 314, 373, 612, 13, 314, 373, 612, 13, 314, 373, 612, 13, 314, 373, 612, 13, 314, 373, 379, 262, 11307, 12816, 13, 314, 373, 612, 13, 843, 612, 373, 257, 1049, 1730, 286, 1561, 546, 2031, 13, 1318, 373, 257, 1049, 1730, 286, 3375, 546, 4486, 13, 843, 314, 373, 612, 13, 314, 373, 612, 13, 314, 716, 1016, 284, 307, 612, 13, 314, 716, 1016, 284, 307, 994, 13, 314, 716, 1016, 284, 307, 379, 262, 11307, 12816, 13, 314, 716, 1016, 284, 307, 612, 13, 314, 716, 994, 13, 314, 716, 287, 2031, 13, 632, 318, 1016, 13, 314, 716, 994, 13, 314, 716, 994, 2637, 198, 198, 1026, 373, 287, 4486, 326, 356, 547, 1498, 284, 651, 617, 286], "prefix_text": "'I saw the whole [European Union] change.

A robust international stockpile could therefore help to ensure that low and middle resource settings receive needed supplies regardless of whether they produce such supplies domestically.

Countries, international organizations, and global transportation companies should work together to maintain travel and trade during severe pandemics. Travel and trade are essential to the global economy as well as to national and even local economies, and they should be maintained even in the face of a pandemic. Improved decision-making, coordination, and communications between the public and private sectors, relating to risk, travel advisories, import/export restrictions, and border measures will be needed. The fear and uncertainty experienced during past outbreaks, even those limited to a national or regional level, have sometimes led to unjustified border measures, the closure of customer-facing businesses, import bans, and the cancellation of airline flights and international shipping. A particularly fast-moving and lethal pandemic could therefore result in political decisions to slow or stop movement of people and goods, potentially harming economies already vulnerable in the face of an outbreak. Ministries of Health and other government agencies should work together now with international airlines and global shipping companies to develop realistic response scenarios and start a contingency planning process with the goal of mitigating economic damage by maintaining key travel and trade routes during a large-scale pandemic. Supporting continued trade and travel in such an extreme circumstance may require the provision of enhanced disease control measures and personal protective equipment for transportation workers, government subsidies to support critical trade routes, and potentially liability protection in certain cases. International organizations including WHO, the International Air Transport Association, and the International Civil Aviation Organization should be partners in these preparedness and response efforts.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [20, 13, 8060, 1597, 815, 7564, 262, 3034, 10538, 286, 19798, 368, 873, 290, 1907, 329, 7387, 5597, 1108, 13, 554, 3090, 284, 14771, 517, 287, 10629, 511, 898, 2706, 290, 11798, 11, 262, 1230, 1276, 635, 7564, 262, 3034, 10538, 290, 1907, 329, 7387, 3034, 5597, 1108, 416, 14771, 287, 511, 2706, 290, 11798, 355, 880, 355, 262, 1230, 447, 247, 82, 898, 4133, 284, 8335, 329, 262, 19798, 5314, 447, 247, 82, 2928, 319, 262, 3773, 11, 355, 880, 355, 262, 1230, 447, 232, 960, 447, 232, 58, 31, 79, 505, 13, 25257, 1485, 486, 12, 33, 6422, 17, 60, 198, 12, 685, 31, 79, 505, 13, 25257, 1157, 2548, 12, 33, 6422, 16, 60, 198, 198, 464, 2159, 5018, 468, 2904, 3199, 257, 989, 9080, 11, 564, 250, 464, 2159, 5018, 447, 247, 82, 8060, 11279, 30096, 447, 251, 326, 3769, 257, 9815, 16700, 286, 3034, 5597, 1108, 290, 262, 6817, 286, 3034, 5410, 287, 262, 3298], "prefix_text": "5.

In addition to other response activities, an increase in and reassessment of pandemic financial support will certainly be needed in a severe pandemic as many sectors of society may need financial support during or after a severe pandemic, including healthcare institutions, essential businesses, and national governments Furthermore, the ways in which these existing funds can now be used are limited. The International Health Regulations prioritize both minimizing public health risks and avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. But there will also be a need to identify critical nodes of the banking system and global and national economies that are too essential to fail - there are some that are likely to need emergency international financial support as well.

Public health authorities should work with private employers and trusted community leaders such as faith leaders, to promulgate factual information to employees and citizens. Trusted, influential private-sector employers should create the capacity to readily and reliably augment public messaging, manage rumours and misinformation, and amplify credible information to support emergency public communications. National public health agencies should work in close collaboration with WHO to create the capability to rapidly develop and release consistent health messages. For their part, media companies should commit to ensuring that authoritative messages are prioritized and that false messages are suppressed including though the use of technology.
