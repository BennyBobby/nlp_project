His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II, and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term, and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in March 1966 to plan the deployment. The year before, Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co @-@ operation role when it finally did deploy. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command, Melbourne, on 8 August 1966. Support Command had been formed in 1959, by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands. On 1 January 1968, Headlam was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff.

The city originally had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites. A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African @-@ American library was demolished on May 28, 2008. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 383, 1748, 318, 262, 10033, 1748, 287, 262, 46348, 11, 13797, 8495, 515, 5991, 9498, 357, 360, 5673, 10612, 543, 3407, 7724, 2488, 11, 31, 11546, 12503, 351, 22884, 3279, 11, 290, 468, 625, 352, 11, 830, 6308, 7000, 287, 262, 1989, 13, 383, 1748, 318, 635, 4983, 355, 262, 1363, 286, 257, 1271, 286, 262, 1748, 338, 4266, 11, 1390, 262, 1748, 338, 1171, 5888, 1080, 11, 262, 1748, 338, 1171, 9358, 1080, 11, 290, 262, 1748, 338, 1323, 1080, 357, 4758, 635, 9179, 257, 1588, 1271, 286, 262, 46348, 1989, 737, 198, 198, 464, 1748, 318, 635, 1363, 284, 1811, 30794, 11, 355, 880, 355, 257, 1271, 286, 584, 29156, 11, 1390, 383, 46348, 9594, 13, 198, 198, 464, 46348, 318, 635, 1363, 284, 262, 46348, 3337, 329, 262, 7443, 286, 262, 1605, 2688, 11, 543, 318, 5140, 287, 262, 46348, 1989, 13, 198, 220, 198, 464, 46348, 338, 717, 9591, 373, 1757, 317, 13, 367], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions", "generated_result": {"0": ", and has over 1,000 retail stores in the area.

Three hours after classification, the depression strengthened Tropical Storm Beatriz, the second named storm of the season. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 12556, 319, 2795, 1160, 11, 24748, 596, 3220, 36841, 351, 1811, 625, 1477, 12494, 21246, 357, 2853, 5191, 416, 6279, 2488, 12, 31, 1353, 10101, 2174, 9746, 4019, 22074, 327, 357, 2488, 12, 31, 1353, 10101, 1022, 1160, 290, 1542, 22074, 327, 8, 6739, 383, 6279, 373, 635, 6515, 319, 262, 4417, 286, 257, 4417, 12, 30176, 4417, 12, 30176, 4417, 4275, 12, 2, 12, 31, 4417, 12, 30176, 828, 351, 617, 6279, 21246, 4478, 625, 1477, 7855, 13, 383, 6279, 21246, 547, 5174, 355, 262, 4417, 12, 17223, 6279, 21246, 11, 290, 262, 15114, 547, 5174, 1262, 262, 6279, 12, 4852, 12, 3106, 11862, 2488, 12, 2, 12, 31, 1353, 12, 17721, 11, 543, 373, 973, 329, 262, 6279, 12, 4852, 12, 3106, 11862, 13, 2488, 12, 2, 12, 2, 12, 2, 12, 2, 12, 2, 12, 2488, 12, 2, 12404, 12, 2, 12, 2, 12, 41573, 12, 2, 2488, 12, 2235, 12, 2, 12], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Early on June 20, convection increased markedly with several overshooting tops ( denoted by cloud @-@ top temperatures below − 80 ° C (", "generated_result": {"0": " @-@ top temperatures between 20 and 30 ° C) ).

The party claims, to the contrary, that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 366, 19061, 366, 373, 530, 286, 262, 717, 8339, 4166, 329, 7326, 6202, 319, 257, 17349, 22343, 11, 1863, 351, 366, 12149, 3205, 366, 290, 366, 10898, 6706, 690, 27071, 198, 366, 383, 366, 366, 366, 366, 366, 366, 366, 366, 366, 366, 383, 3496, 366, 366, 198, 366, 366, 198, 366, 921, 366, 373, 257, 3496, 416, 257, 4097, 1444, 309, 13, 40, 13, 34, 13, 36, 290, 340, 550, 257, 1049, 4588, 287, 262, 2647, 995, 13, 198, 366, 366, 198, 366, 366, 220, 198, 366, 366, 220, 198, 366, 220, 198, 1, 921, 366, 373, 257, 3496, 416, 257, 4097, 1444, 366, 309, 3978, 13, 34, 1, 36, 290, 340, 550, 281, 4588, 287, 262, 2647, 995, 290, 287, 262, 2647, 2831, 13, 198, 464, 4097, 366, 366, 198, 366, 366, 220, 198, 464, 366, 366, 366, 366, 366, 366, 357, 51, 3978, 13, 40, 13, 34, 8, 36, 550, 257, 1049, 4588, 287, 262], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> \" Sorry \" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with \" Hung Up \" and \" Future Lovers \".", "generated_result": {"0": "\n \" The \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" The song \" \"\n \" \"\n \" You \" was a song by a band called T.I.C.E and it had a great influence in the music world.\n \" \"\n \" \" \n \" \" \n \" \n\" You \" was a song by a band called \" TII.C\"E and it had an influence in the music world and in the music industry.\nThe band \" \"\n \" \" \nThe \" \" \" \" \" \" (TII.I.C)E had a great influence in the"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> \" Sorry \" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with \" Hung Up \" and \" Future Lovers \".", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> \" Sorry \" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with \" Hung Up \" and \" Future Lovers \".\n \" The \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" The song \" \"\n \" \"\n \" You \" was a song by a band called T.I.C.E and it had a great influence in the music world.\n \" \"\n \" \" \n \" \" \n \" \n\" You \" was a song by a band called \" TII.C\"E and it had an influence in the music world and in the music industry.\nThe band \" \"\n \" \" \nThe \" \" \" \" \" \" (TII.I.C)E had a great influence in the", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> \" Sorry \" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with \" Hung Up \" and \" Future Lovers \".

Among the various remixes, the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston's \" I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) \" with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction. Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other, from the time they wrote the song \" Heart \" ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it. The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album Disco Four.

For example, it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete's strength ( the first time TxDOT had ever done so ), and contained an early completion bonus, a sliding scale of up to $ 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years. Also built into the construction contract was a provision that Zachry was charged for \" lane rentals \" by TxDOT for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on hourly assessments and the time of day the lane was closed. The fees ranged from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @,@ 000 for rush hours. In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction, the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and viaducts so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed.

That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point. NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track. It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps, and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields. Two hours later, the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third. After Richmond's car was adjusted to remove the \" push \", the car was more to his liking. Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left.

McDermitt Creek begins in Oregon a few miles north of The Granites and flows generally east, crossing the Oregon – Nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor of the Quinn River Valley south of McDermitt. \n"}, {"ended": true, "tokens": [50256, 383, 42542, 13509, 21124, 389, 13160, 4632, 286, 1615, 2501, 422, 257, 7614, 32410, 326, 1752, 6204, 810, 2441, 641, 9638, 318, 1909, 13, 3864, 436, 282, 7888, 768, 290, 262, 3881, 318, 783, 257, 6546, 7679, 286, 3881, 351, 257, 7888, 7679, 286, 47969, 13, 383, 3881, 318, 257, 11710, 286, 47969, 290, 257, 11710, 925, 286, 257, 11710, 422, 47969, 290, 47969, 13, 383, 3881, 4909, 281, 9812, 4996, 290, 318, 262, 691, 1517, 326, 460, 307, 531, 546, 340, 13, 198, 198, 19927, 198, 464, 42542, 5866, 11, 42542, 13509, 21124, 11, 42542, 13509, 22099, 11, 7492, 11, 1578, 1829, 11, 1248, 6469, 13, 198, 198, 27313, 1058, 10082, 4867, 286, 7492, 198, 27313, 25, 10082, 4867, 12, 5363, 8341, 198, 9], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The Trout Creek Mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today.

The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land now known as the Trout Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon.
