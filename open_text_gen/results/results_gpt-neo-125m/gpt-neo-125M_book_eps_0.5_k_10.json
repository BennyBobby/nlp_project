With one step forward and two backward in that posture, and a jerk of the head, they completed the exotic macosa dance.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [32, 3956, 326, 5495, 2241, 416, 3624, 3891, 379, 257, 467, 550, 1282, 503, 284, 1577, 257, 3315, 9709, 220, 1682, 11, 326, 373, 262, 299, 3674, 565, 1300, 25699, 3804, 319, 262, 1438, 220, 284, 6901, 326, 1438, 326, 1625, 287, 262, 1296, 262, 1438, 220, 286, 262, 582, 508, 561, 307, 262, 2426, 286, 262, 1332, 2482, 13, 632, 373, 262, 3891, 339, 6412, 284, 326, 550, 257, 1438, 287, 262, 3504, 286, 326, 1438, 13, 383, 1438, 220, 1625, 287, 220, 618, 262, 582, 508, 561, 423, 587, 262, 2426, 286, 883, 5254, 373, 262, 530, 508, 561, 220, 307, 1444, 262, 582, 508, 561, 651, 606, 13, 220, 198, 198, 2396, 326, 373, 703, 257, 3956, 1625, 503, 290, 531, 11, 262, 1438, 986, 220, 340, 531, 11, 220, 262, 1438, 220, 286, 2130, 508, 561, 307, 262, 2426, 508, 561, 651, 262, 1637, 13, 220, 198, 2396, 340, 373, 407, 262, 976, 220], "prefix_text": "A brother that introduced himself by eight names at a go had come out to give a medical testimony  actually, that was the nomenclature commentators passed on", "generated_result": {"0": " the name  to describe that name that came in the form the name  of the man who would be the subject of the test results.

The General Overseer of Jesus My Lord Ministries, Pastor TunjiAdetiloye, grabbed the wireless microphone laid, for his personal use, on the stool to his left and stood up to go behind the pulpit. His two associates, sitting one to his left and the other to his right on upright chairs resembling ones at the heads of a dining table, stood up in accordance with the entrenched tradition of pre-message respect for the GO. Their Daddy-in-the-Lord progressed from his armchair to the tinted all-glass pulpit. His Bible had earlier been placed on the lectern by the armour-bearer who had proceeded to carry it from the stool on the right immediately the choir rounded off their special rendition - the cue for the message. The five-and-a-half-feet tall man of God stood on the podium and for the next two to three minutes would say nothing; his eyes roamed wild among the puzzled people. The gaze went to the choir and stayed for some troubling seconds. They were well dressed  every one female among them had something in the name of a hat to cover her head, as opposed to some members on the floor who adopted a free stance. Their music, too, had been superb right from the praises to the just concluded rendition. So, what is it? The stare left them wondering as it went 180 degrees to the Pastor's aides standing at ease on his left. Neither of them had come late for the pre-service ministers' prayer and every ministerial assignment given to them so far in the service they had carried out to the best of their abilities. Why the suspicious look? His eyes turned over to the degrees they had come to meet the bewildered gape of the floor members. What is wrong with Pastor? Hope all is well. Such was the tone of the muted conversation in the house of God. His silence was finally broken and what followed was the most unusual message they had ever had from that altar.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [6, 40, 760, 345, 1244, 423, 14028, 644, 468, 1282, 2402, 534, 38256, 13, 3363, 11, 262, 835, 314, 2900, 616, 1182, 1088, 287, 9550, 373, 8468, 290, 287, 1109, 12986, 13, 679, 3947, 845, 881, 588, 502, 13, 314, 373, 257, 1643, 36249, 416, 465, 5408, 475, 314, 1422, 63, 83, 892, 339, 35661, 502, 355, 339, 6807, 1497, 13, 198, 41481, 376, 11698, 9328, 36387, 37966, 198, 10970, 376, 17133, 3963, 347, 6239, 2538, 1268, 1546, 5357, 3336, 367, 1340, 1581, 6234, 3963, 327, 1137, 30339, 347, 6239, 2538, 16309, 198, 198, 1135, 389, 477, 287, 262, 976, 1295, 25, 262, 976, 1295, 11, 262, 6697, 284, 262, 584, 13, 775, 389, 477, 287, 530, 4136, 11, 262, 1295, 810, 356, 389, 11706, 960, 1169, 1295, 287, 543, 356, 1254, 749, 379, 1363, 11, 393, 749, 379, 1363, 960, 1169, 1295, 810, 356, 389, 749, 6792, 290, 749, 6792, 13, 843, 356, 836, 63, 83, 423, 326, 13], "prefix_text": "'I know you might have wondered what has come upon your Pastor.

As usual, I had prepared today's sermon through some sleepless nights searching the scriptures and praying that the message makes meaningful impact on our lives. Up to five minutes ago I had maintained the status quo waiting for the time to preach. Then, all of a sudden, I heard the voice of the spirit of God in my spirit clearly saying, \"It's a mad world: a world of breakneck speed: 30 seconds-microwave oven, pop-in-and-eat fast food outlets, near-speed-of-light rocket, real-time internet networking and the much-fantasized human cloning that will need no 9-month pregnancy.

The service is called short message and it should remain as such. He looked for ways of trimming down the text to one page. After reading through twice he discovered he had been too generous with spaces. He removed the space immediately after every punctuation mark and operation sign. Still the character-and-page number indicator was reading 279/2. What could he do? He removed the 'g' ending all the present participle verb forms. He abbreviated 'months' to 'mths' and 'because' to 'cos', then 'at' was transformed to its internet sign, '@', and the conjunction 'and' to its popular symbol '&'. When it would still not go for one page he finally decided to delete 'shalom' and was happy with what he saw at the corner  300/1. No wonder some of his friends called him SMS Ijebu.

She couldn't figure out what the revenge was all about. She knew it had something to do with her, but as yet, no one, including the king, her Guardian, or her friend Jocelyn, had been forthcoming with any information whichever tact she used to try and wheedle it out of them. She felt in her heart that they knew exactly what Vivianna's motive was, but they were being tight lipped about it. If it was one thing she had learned in the short time she'd known them, it was that fairies could be extremely stubborn when they wanted to be.

Their innumerable carvings of demons and dragons assumed a mournful aspect. The restless light of the flames made them seem to move. There were serpents, which seemed to be laughing, gargoyles yelping, salamanders blowing the fire, dragons sneezing amid the smoke.

The Global Preparedness Monitoring Board would be well positioned to help monitor and contribute to the efforts that governments, international organizations and businesses should take for pandemic preparedness and response.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [17, 13, 17420, 11, 2260, 6905, 11, 290, 3230, 5745, 815, 670, 1978, 284, 9494, 19765, 2714, 29534, 2915, 286, 3315, 3753, 47336, 357, 9655, 10128, 8, 284, 7139, 5801, 290, 37164, 1895, 13, 198, 1212, 989, 318, 3562, 284, 2209, 262, 1708, 3006, 25, 198, 16, 13, 383, 761, 329, 257, 2260, 1535, 290, 3747, 1080, 11, 1390, 262, 779, 286, 13122, 5673, 290, 584, 3753, 47336, 287, 281, 6334, 11, 355, 880, 329, 584, 36047, 13, 198, 17, 65, 13, 1052, 4050, 290, 22080, 2260, 13122, 44, 1080, 284, 1805, 262, 3265, 290, 1535, 287, 1502, 284, 2948, 262, 9793, 286, 262, 649, 2563, 284, 262, 17432, 355, 2582, 355, 1744, 13, 1114, 1672, 11, 262, 2351, 3893, 1222, 6895, 268, 316, 434, 2191, 286, 4751, 357, 45, 7998, 4090, 8, 2585, 564, 240, 564, 240, 564, 251, 464, 2351, 3893, 9985, 4482, 447, 240, 13, 198, 198, 17, 70, 8, 383, 761, 329, 257, 22080, 2260, 2882], "prefix_text": "2.

As one possible approach, this virtual stockpile model could be expanded to augment WHO's ability to distribute vaccines and therapeutics to countries in the greatest need during a severe pandemic. This should also include any available experimental vaccine stockpiles for any WHO R&D Blueprint pathogens to deploy in a clinical trial during outbreaks in collaboration with CEPI, GAVI, and WHO. Other approaches could involve regional stockpiles or bi- or multinational agreements. During a catastrophic outbreak, countries may be reluctant to part with scarce medical resources. A robust international stockpile could therefore help to ensure that low and middle resource settings receive needed supplies regardless of whether they produce such supplies domestically.

Countries, international organizations, and global transportation companies should work together to maintain travel and trade during severe pandemics. Travel and trade are essential to the global economy as well as to national and even local economies, and they should be maintained even in the face of a pandemic. Improved decision-making, coordination, and communications between the public and private sectors, relating to risk, travel advisories, import/export restrictions, and border measures will be needed. The fear and uncertainty experienced during past outbreaks, even those limited to a national or regional level, have sometimes led to unjustified border measures, the closure of customer-facing businesses, import bans, and the cancellation of airline flights and international shipping. A particularly fast-moving and lethal pandemic could therefore result in political decisions to slow or stop movement of people and goods, potentially harming economies already vulnerable in the face of an outbreak. Ministries of Health and other government agencies should work together now with international airlines and global shipping companies to develop realistic response scenarios and start a contingency planning process with the goal of mitigating economic damage by maintaining key travel and trade routes during a large-scale pandemic. Supporting continued trade and travel in such an extreme circumstance may require the provision of enhanced disease control measures and personal protective equipment for transportation workers, government subsidies to support critical trade routes, and potentially liability protection in certain cases. International organizations including WHO, the International Air Transport Association, and the International Civil Aviation Organization should be partners in these preparedness and response efforts.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [20, 13, 8060, 1597, 815, 7564, 262, 3034, 10538, 286, 19798, 368, 873, 290, 1907, 329, 7387, 5597, 1108, 13, 554, 3090, 284, 14771, 517, 287, 10629, 511, 898, 2706, 290, 11798, 11, 356, 761, 284, 7564, 290, 2209, 883, 4497, 351, 262, 3176, 290, 1597, 4258, 13, 198, 198, 17, 13, 1374, 460, 356, 1037, 30, 198, 198, 1135, 1276, 7564, 674, 3298, 1597, 355, 281, 1593, 8271, 329, 1111, 5922, 257, 1365, 995, 355, 880, 355, 24175, 262, 3773, 11, 355, 636, 290, 25232, 286, 340, 477, 329, 262, 1365, 290, 329, 262, 1365, 13, 198, 198, 18, 13, 1374, 460, 356, 1805, 674, 3298, 6884, 416, 14771, 287, 674, 6884, 30, 198, 1026, 318, 1593, 284, 1805, 6731, 422, 262, 5290, 286, 262, 5290, 287, 262, 995, 13, 198, 198, 19, 383, 995, 318, 257, 3716, 1295, 13, 198, 464, 995, 318, 257, 3716, 1295, 290, 530, 543, 468, 284, 307, 6861, 13, 198, 1858, 389, 867], "prefix_text": "5.

We call on leaders in global business, international organizations, and national governments to launch an ambitious effort to work together to build a world better prepared for a severe pandemic.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2514, 867, 11, 2106, 3940, 257, 387, 746, 26267, 3108, 11, 284, 1728, 11, 2592, 617, 2116, 12, 562, 1522, 474, 32735, 2569, 5538, 287, 3576, 351, 257, 30889, 329, 13735, 11, 290, 257, 16826, 329, 262, 2003, 284, 307, 262, 1944, 290, 284, 307, 1775, 355, 884, 329, 262, 1944, 13, 198, 818, 616, 898, 640, 616, 1393, 287, 3517, 2106, 468, 587, 287, 326, 11, 287, 262, 1613, 11, 314, 447, 240, 303, 1690, 1807, 286, 5491, 355, 257, 1613, 14234, 286, 2106, 287, 262, 835, 340, 373, 878, 674, 640, 13, 198, 1212, 14268, 318, 546, 262, 2278, 286, 6754, 4088, 11, 407, 2106, 290, 2106, 12, 8601, 2346, 13, 11317, 11, 663, 1388, 14613, 9018, 262, 2106, 286, 262, 1578, 7526, 286, 3878, 5491, 13, 198, 198, 1026, 318, 257, 13899, 1808, 13, 632, 318, 257, 1808, 329, 262, 9173, 284, 37375, 13, 554, 262, 1578, 7526, 11, 262, 4088, 326, 318, 262, 6754, 4088, 12], "prefix_text": "To many, history followed a haphazard path, to certain, especially some self-assured jingoistic figures in London with a nostalgia for empire,", "generated_result": {"0": " and a willingness for the future to be the present and to be seen as such for the present.\nIn my own time my interest in British history has been in that, in the past, I‒ve often thought of Britain as a pastiche of history in the way it was before our time.\nThis essay is about the period of historical memory, not history and history-making itself.

That was evidently far from John or Anna's personal ideas. They sought something more scientific, a pattern, an overriding logic. They were not the first, some, like Spengler and Toynbee, dreamt of rationalizing history, others, from Adam Smith to Joseph Schumpeter, attempted the same thing through economics, and Peter Turchin through the rise of empires, all of which laid the foundations for the new scientific field of cliodynamics, after the Greek muse of history, Clio, and the word dynamics--force and motion. In other words the forces that drive history, and in this precise case the development of a hypothetical mathematical model to explain it.\n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2504, 531, 867, 20006, 290, 43310, 550, 6825, 262, 8848, 329, 257, 1271, 286, 3716, 3840, 11, 290, 12077, 606, 547, 883, 508, 7052, 284, 287, 7075, 286, 262, 3482, 34161, 262, 4576, 13, 198, 464, 1388, 1738, 329, 511, 3015, 373, 326, 484, 547, 407, 1498, 357, 273, 4684, 357, 273, 4684, 8, 286, 8, 284, 3015, 329, 11435, 13, 198, 198, 464, 11435, 1923, 287, 262, 3482, 373, 281, 2230, 286, 262, 1230, 286, 262, 2739, 6303, 11, 290, 340, 550, 587, 4388, 13, 632, 2497, 262, 3482, 2666, 262, 4576, 290, 262, 3482, 7052, 1028, 340, 13, 1320, 373, 262, 1738, 1521, 262, 3482, 550, 7052, 319, 262, 11467, 13, 198, 198, 40, 561, 588, 11, 611, 345, 561, 3387, 11, 284, 910, 326, 262, 3482, 750, 5626, 8420, 340, 329, 262, 4576, 379, 1551, 1566, 262, 886, 286, 262, 4576, 13, 1002, 345, 836, 11, 262, 3482, 750, 407, 2666, 287, 262, 1218, 491, 77, 13], "prefix_text": "That said many Europeans and Britons had missed the boat for a number of complex reasons, and amongst them were those who voted to in favour of the UK quitting the", "generated_result": {"0": " EU.\nThe main reason for their vote was that they were not able (or willing (or willing) of) to vote for Brexit.\n\nThe Brexit campaign in the UK was an attempt of the government of the late 1990, and it had been successful.
