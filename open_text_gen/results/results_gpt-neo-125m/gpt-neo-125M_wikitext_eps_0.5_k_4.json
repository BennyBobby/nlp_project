His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II, and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term, and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in March 1966 to plan the deployment. The year before, Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co @-@ operation role when it finally did deploy. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command, Melbourne, on 8 August 1966. Support Command had been formed in 1959, by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands. On 1 January 1968, Headlam was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff. He served as an Extra Gentleman Usher to the Queen from 17 November 1970 to 5 June 1971. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 337, 2488, 12, 31, 9415, 6140, 379, 257, 35037, 351, 337, 2488, 12, 31, 7982, 290, 347, 2488, 12, 31, 9907, 7421, 286, 38433, 756, 13, 770, 35037, 318, 379, 257, 35037, 351, 317, 25248, 20416, 290, 337, 347, 2488, 12, 65, 13, 383, 734, 10891, 2733, 389, 379, 257, 35037, 286, 317, 2488, 65, 290, 337, 317, 2488, 12, 65, 13, 383, 734, 10891, 2733, 286, 317, 2488, 65, 290, 337, 347, 2488, 12, 65, 389, 379, 257, 44410, 317, 347, 2488, 12, 66, 13, 383, 734, 10891, 2733, 286, 262, 734, 337, 317, 317, 347, 347, 317, 2488, 12, 66, 389, 379, 257, 44410, 317, 347, 2488, 64, 13, 317, 337, 2488, 12, 65, 318, 379, 257, 44410, 317, 2488, 12, 66, 13, 317, 337, 2488, 64, 318, 379, 262, 35037, 286, 317, 347, 2488, 64, 13, 317, 2488, 12, 65, 318, 319, 262, 35037, 286, 317, 2488, 65, 11, 347, 347, 2488, 12, 64, 318], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> M @-@ 82 begins at a junction with M @-@ 120 and B @-@ 96 west of Fremont.

The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born Architect Louis S. Curtiss, famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper, is extant on Highland Park. The Frank Fort designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit's famed Fisher Building. Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 46348, 468, 635, 587, 6163, 355, 262, 2003, 4067, 286, 262, 13797, 11536, 290, 11058, 3337, 357, 8779, 2943, 6739, 383, 13797, 20815, 6325, 262, 2126, 287, 5878, 290, 287, 5075, 340, 2627, 262, 717, 1181, 12, 11990, 10848, 290, 6467, 3641, 286, 663, 2546, 287, 262, 1578, 7526, 11, 262, 691, 884, 3641, 287, 2253, 284, 423, 587, 3170, 379, 257, 1575, 286, 720, 16, 13, 20, 2997, 287, 262, 1578, 1829, 11, 351, 262, 4387, 884, 3641, 287, 262, 995, 13, 198, 198, 18122, 198, 44, 2007, 7920, 373, 4642, 287, 968, 1971, 11, 290, 6348, 656, 262, 1748, 338, 13325, 16997, 1641, 13, 7920, 338, 2988, 3111, 355, 257, 1097, 26419, 290, 465, 17695, 3111, 329, 262, 968, 1971, 2254, 2732, 286, 12533, 31365, 13, 7920, 338, 2988, 3111, 379, 262, 968, 1971, 5094, 4809, 11819, 1566, 465, 1918, 287, 15674, 13, 679, 3111, 355, 257, 1097, 26419, 290, 465, 18410, 3111, 355, 262, 1182], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( MAEC ).

From this bond, the Wechsler School was built in 1894, becoming the first brick public school building in the state built for blacks. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 46348, 318, 1363, 284, 734, 1281, 2488, 12, 31, 9233, 9856, 6712, 13, 46348, 8108, 5535, 11, 9393, 287, 28684, 11, 318, 5140, 379, 860, 940, 14914, 678, 399, 290, 4394, 257, 3094, 4996, 286, 4056, 290, 4568, 13, 46348, 8108, 5535, 4394, 257, 1271, 286, 4056, 326, 389, 3562, 5734, 329, 883, 508, 765, 257, 3451, 287, 1597, 13, 46348, 468, 257, 3094, 4996, 286, 9856, 4056, 326, 460, 307, 973, 329, 883, 508, 4601, 13, 198, 198, 44, 419, 261, 8108, 3337, 318, 257, 2055, 3641, 329, 262, 2055, 286, 46348, 326, 318, 5140, 287, 46348, 8108, 13, 46348, 8108, 5535, 318, 5140, 379, 718, 1415, 2520, 8774, 5567, 290, 318, 1280, 284, 2444, 290, 3085, 13, 198, 198, 13102, 295, 8108, 4564, 318, 257, 4928, 326, 318, 1280, 329, 11892, 287, 46348, 11, 46348, 290, 46348, 4302, 8108, 3337, 13, 198, 198, 13102, 295, 5535, 468, 257, 3094, 6356, 286, 10902, 326, 389, 973, 329, 2444], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Meridian is home to two post @-@ secondary educational institutions.

A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African @-@ American library was demolished on May 28, 2008. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 383, 1748, 318, 262, 10033, 1748, 287, 262, 46348, 11, 13797, 8495, 515, 5991, 9498, 357, 360, 5673, 10612, 543, 3407, 7724, 2488, 11, 31, 11546, 12503, 351, 22884, 3279, 357, 6849, 82, 10612, 290, 262, 4387, 2060, 1910, 1989, 286, 13797, 2254, 357, 337, 5639, 6739, 383, 4387, 2060, 1910, 1989, 357, 337, 7792, 1267, 3407, 262, 1748, 286, 46348, 11, 13797, 357, 6579, 10612, 351, 257, 3265, 12109, 286, 352, 11, 23, 1485, 13, 21, 661, 583, 6616, 10591, 13, 383, 1748, 318, 5140, 287, 262, 8372, 636, 357, 13797, 1267, 286, 262, 1748, 286, 46348, 290, 318, 257, 1688, 3641, 287, 262, 13797, 5866, 16978, 13, 46348, 318, 257, 1688, 3641, 290, 257, 3641, 329, 262, 13797, 5866, 11, 543, 15623, 656, 262, 7850, 290, 318, 1363, 286, 6409, 18180, 13, 383, 1748, 635, 4909, 257, 1588, 1271, 286, 1402, 11684, 290, 4736, 11, 1390, 6612, 290, 46348, 13, 383, 46348, 318, 257, 1688, 18473], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions", "generated_result": {"0": " (TVs ), and the largest single market area of Mississippi City ( MLC ).

Lead Belly was invited to perform at Camp Unity, the Communist Party USA's summer retreat, and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s.

For example, it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete's strength ( the first time TxDOT had ever done so ), and contained an early completion bonus, a sliding scale of up to $ 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years. Also built into the construction contract was a provision that Zachry was charged for \" lane rentals \" by TxDOT for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on hourly assessments and the time of day the lane was closed. The fees ranged from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @,@ 000 for rush hours. In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction, the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and viaducts so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed.

Richmond raced in three more events that season. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 2293, 21899, 1141, 262, 717, 1110, 286, 18677, 329, 262, 7169, 19362, 5323, 11, 16940, 19032, 6492, 262, 678, 400, 3599, 2292, 287, 262, 3234, 13, 679, 3111, 465, 835, 510, 284, 1218, 287, 257, 3234, 326, 561, 423, 1813, 683, 262, 3663, 284, 1592, 262, 19362, 7337, 13, 554, 262, 1218, 3234, 11, 16940, 373, 1218, 11, 475, 339, 550, 257, 922, 923, 290, 550, 262, 3663, 284, 1592, 465, 1218, 26023, 1097, 3234, 13, 679, 635, 550, 1194, 2863, 284, 5160, 262, 3599, 2292, 11, 290, 373, 1218, 287, 262, 3234, 706, 257, 6028, 2245, 13, 198, 198, 818, 465, 2457, 1622, 287, 26023, 11, 262, 8488, 2297, 8266, 1074, 1839, 262, 19362, 7337, 11, 12848, 287, 1218, 1295, 13, 679, 5201, 5544, 290, 8150, 287, 257, 3234, 326, 561, 423, 3142, 683, 284, 1592, 262, 19362, 5323, 13, 198, 198, 49, 4092, 2106, 198, 198, 20988, 19639, 1881, 198, 198, 19927, 220, 198, 198, 27313, 25], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> After crashing during the first day of qualifying for the 1980 Indianapolis 500, Richmond nevertheless obtained the 19th starting position in the race.

Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 383, 42542, 13509, 21124, 389, 10663, 2488, 12, 31, 610, 312, 780, 484, 389, 287, 262, 10183, 6290, 9082, 286, 8598, 16069, 284, 262, 7421, 13, 1649, 13394, 1633, 422, 262, 7850, 2058, 287, 11, 340, 481, 307, 845, 9583, 13, 383, 7850, 481, 307, 257, 845, 9583, 1295, 284, 2107, 13, 383, 39459, 318, 257, 845, 5894, 1295, 13, 198, 198, 464, 42542, 13509, 21124, 11, 543, 389, 287, 29424, 71, 4584, 290, 287, 262, 3504, 11, 389, 257, 845, 5894, 4136, 11, 290, 262, 39459, 318, 257, 845, 9583, 530, 284, 2107, 351, 345, 11, 290, 262, 1660, 481, 307, 845, 4692, 287, 262, 7850, 13, 1649, 262, 6290, 2058, 287, 11, 340, 318, 845, 9583, 13, 383, 39459, 318, 257, 845, 5894, 1295, 11, 290, 262, 1660, 287, 428, 39459, 318, 845, 4692, 287, 262, 7850, 13, 198, 1858, 318, 257, 845, 9583, 7850, 287, 262, 42542, 5866, 34164, 11, 290, 257, 845, 5894, 1295, 284, 2107], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The Trout Creek Mountains are semi @-@ arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west.

Narrow riparian greenways follow the year @-@ round streams. Many greenway areas have quaking aspen and willow groves. Cottonwood and alder groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is flatter and stream channels are wider. Sedges and rushes are also native to these stream bottoms. Years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species, riparian vegetation, and young aspen and willow trees. Restoration of riparian areas began in the early 1970s, and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, large wildfires in southeastern Oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range's vegetation, damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50256, 25390, 287, 262, 42542, 13509, 21124, 389, 16573, 284, 262, 2858, 286, 262, 3334, 18692, 13, 350, 36670, 1211, 389, 2219, 287, 262, 1280, 11, 35021, 32680, 2488, 12, 31, 5017, 351, 257, 6546, 316, 286, 35021, 290, 35021, 32680, 11, 290, 262, 2219, 287, 1280, 11, 35021, 14093, 2488, 12, 2, 11, 290, 262, 2219, 379, 1877, 22910, 13, 383, 35021, 32680, 287, 262, 42542, 327, 1604, 338, 13509, 318, 257, 2219, 287, 262, 42542, 13509, 327, 29480, 13, 383, 42542, 13509, 327, 1604, 318, 257, 2219, 287, 262, 3334, 12946, 13, 383, 42542, 327, 1604, 318, 257, 845, 2219, 287, 262, 42542, 5866, 13, 383, 42542, 327, 874, 389, 2219, 287, 1111, 262, 42542, 13509, 327, 1604, 290, 42542, 327, 1747, 13509, 290, 262, 327, 1604, 338, 13509, 327, 1999, 11, 290, 389, 257, 2219, 1871, 262, 42542, 327, 874, 13, 198, 464, 42542, 34, 1604, 318, 257, 2219, 286, 1111, 262, 42542, 13509, 13509, 327, 29480], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Animals in the Trout Creek Mountains are adapted to the environment of the High Desert.
