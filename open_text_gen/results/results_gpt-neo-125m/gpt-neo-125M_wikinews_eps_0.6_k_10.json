Mawson had apparently decided to use the machine as a motorised sled instead; however, the engine wouldn't function properly under very low temperatures, and the plane was later abandoned.\n\"[We've used a] Magnetometer, ground-penetrating radar, metal detectors and all sorts of things to try and look for it, but in the end it was just a combination of a very low tide, good weather and a thin ice melt,\" commented Tony Stewart, a member of the team, as quoted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \"Our carpenter was just taking a walk along the beach and just saw the metal in 10 centimetres of water, just right next to the ice.\"\n\"The ice melts back very quickly, it's on the edge of a harbour which is covered in sea ice most of the year and then as summer comes the edge of the ice gradually pulls off in huge chunks,\" he continued. \"This is the first time those rocks have been exposed in that area for some time so we've been walking around that area above the air tractor not knowing it was there under our feet all this time.\""}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2025, 23272, 12, 86, 30449, 30886, 582, 7482, 284, 2270, 656, 262, 2156, 286, 8381, 16251, 396, 20642, 32104, 36232, 319, 3217, 1755, 287, 644, 262, 20849, 4765, 9345, 4809, 1444, 257, 366, 42002, 1368, 526, 198, 198, 464, 20849, 12, 50, 2860, 321, 4430, 2139, 531, 262, 4099, 11, 257, 30886, 19834, 11, 468, 587, 11816, 287, 465, 1363, 287, 262, 1748, 286, 509, 328, 2731, 287, 262, 8372, 8473, 11, 810, 339, 3160, 355, 636, 286, 281, 3230, 7417, 1448, 13, 198, 198, 464, 1368, 5091, 379, 546, 352, 25, 2327, 287, 262, 1755, 11, 618, 262, 2156, 286, 262, 16251, 396, 373, 31158, 416, 1115, 30886, 1450, 11, 1864, 284, 262, 20849, 1644, 13, 198, 198, 51, 4454, 290, 2184, 12, 430, 271, 3196, 287, 16490, 423, 635, 4602, 326, 262, 4099, 373, 11816, 739, 257, 5509, 13, 628, 220, 685, 5569, 383, 20849, 4765, 9345, 6168, 6, 989, 319, 262, 1368, 319, 509, 328, 2731, 319], "prefix_text": "An axe-wielding Somali man attempted to break into the house of controversial cartoonist Kurt Westergaard on Friday night in what the Danish Security Intelligence Service called a", "generated_result": {"0": " \"terrorist attack.\"\n\nThe Danish-Saddam intelligence service said the suspect, a Somali businessman, has been hiding in his home in the city of Kiguel in the southern province, where he lives as part of an international terrorist group.\n\nThe attack occurred at about 1:35 in the night, when the house of the cartoonist was raided by three Somali men, according to the Danish police.\n\nTrial and court-raisements in Denmark have also revealed that the suspect was hiding under a tree.\n\n  [Read The Danish Security Intelligence Services' report on the attack on Kiguel on"}, "prompt": "An axe-wielding Somali man attempted to break into the house of controversial cartoonist Kurt Westergaard on Friday night in what the Danish Security Intelligence Service called a", "gen_text": "An axe-wielding Somali man attempted to break into the house of controversial cartoonist Kurt Westergaard on Friday night in what the Danish Security Intelligence Service called a \"terrorist attack.\"\n\nThe Danish-Saddam intelligence service said the suspect, a Somali businessman, has been hiding in his home in the city of Kiguel in the southern province, where he lives as part of an international terrorist group.\n\nThe attack occurred at about 1:35 in the night, when the house of the cartoonist was raided by three Somali men, according to the Danish police.\n\nTrial and court-raisements in Denmark have also revealed that the suspect was hiding under a tree.\n\n  [Read The Danish Security Intelligence Services' report on the attack on Kiguel on", "reference_text": "An axe-wielding Somali man attempted to break into the house of controversial cartoonist Kurt Westergaard on Friday night in what the Danish Security Intelligence Service called a terror-related attack.

Tobacco oil can be very efficiently converted to biofuel, but most oil is located in the seeds, which the plant does not produce many of.\nTobacco seeds produce around 40% oil per dry weight but a crop of the plant yields only around 600kg of seeds per acre.  The leaves have an oil content of around 1.74% oil per dry weight.  The oil has previously been tested for powering diesel-fueled vehicles and can be more efficiently converted than the product of many other crop plants.\nThe team from BFL identified that oil production in the leaves was controlled by two genes: the diacyglycerol acytransferase (DGAT) and the LEAFY COTYLEDON 2 (LEC2) genes. By genetic engineering, they achieved oil yields of 5.8% oil per dry weight by modifying the DGAT while changes to the LEC2 resulted in a yield of 6.8% per dry weight.\n\"Tobacco is very attractive as a biofuel because the idea is to use plants that aren't used in food production,\" said cancer biology assistant professor at Thomas Jefferson Dr Vyacheslav Andrianov, Ph.D. \"In some instances, the modified plants produced 20-fold more oil in the leaves.\" \nVarious efforts are being made to find biofuel sources that are not also potential food, in order to steer clear of causing further rises in global food costs. Last month the US government anounced funding for research that used nonphotosynthesising micro-organisms to manufacture biodiesel, in the hope that this will prove more efficient than options that rely on photosynthesis. This also escapes one criticism of biofuels like tobacco; that competition for land to grow crops on will result in biofuel crops displacing foodstuffs and pushing food prices up. In November 2009 a Spanish team launched a study to determine if tobacco, as well as the prickly pear, was capable of withstanding the harsh conditions of land not suitable for growing food, selecting these plants for their ability to survive water shortages."}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [464, 6182, 27607, 1839, 1028, 262, 8857, 30652, 379, 6182, 338, 9566, 19426, 1014, 3250, 5033, 262, 717, 1363, 1074, 284, 1592, 262, 9481, 10633, 13449, 287, 2166, 286, 257, 4315, 286, 517, 621, 352, 11, 830, 3296, 13, 2293, 262, 983, 11, 262, 734, 3951, 286, 1938, 2540, 284, 9197, 287, 262, 9197, 11, 290, 262, 27607, 547, 2957, 416, 262, 717, 1683, 6182, 32246, 11, 4995, 327, 278, 533, 15516, 13, 198, 198, 464, 4315, 287, 262, 19426, 3822, 3250, 318, 352, 11, 9879, 11, 523, 262, 27607, 547, 1498, 284, 651, 257, 19350, 379, 617, 3499, 7188, 287, 262, 983, 851, 2592, 262, 717, 640, 262, 30652, 1839, 511, 717, 14167, 5454, 11, 618, 484, 7781, 257, 3061, 319, 257, 3061, 416, 262, 8857, 30652, 13, 198, 447, 250, 2215, 345, 651, 284, 262, 4771, 326, 447, 253, 82, 618, 345, 651, 6568, 329, 262, 2187, 983, 3926, 290, 788, 345, 651, 284, 766, 606, 757, 618], "prefix_text": "The Boston Bruins won against the Philadelphia Flyers at Boston's historic Fenway Park becoming the first home team to win the NHL Winter Classic in front of a crowd of", "generated_result": {"0": " more than 1,000 fans.

The general, who oversees the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, recently announced that the United States would more than double its security aid to the impoverished nation.\nThe United States gave $67 million last year to Yemen, the only country that receives more aid is Pakistan with $112 million, according to the Associated Press.\nYesterday, in his weekly radio address, President Barack Obama linked the suspect in the attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to al-Qaeda saying, \"We know that he traveled to Yemen, a country grappling with crushing poverty and deadly insurgencies. It appears that he joined an affiliate of al-Qaeda, and that this group, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, trained him, equipped him with those explosives and directed him to attack that plane headed for America.\"\nObama annouced, \"So, as President, I've made it a priority to strengthen our partnership with the Yemeni government-training and equipping their security forces, sharing intelligence and working with them to strike al-Qaeda terrorists.\"\nObama said that they had already results prior to the Christmas Day bombing attempt saying, \"So, as President, I've made it a priority to strengthen our partnership with the Yemeni government-training and equipping their security forces, sharing intelligence and working with them to strike al-Qaeda terrorists.\"\nBritain has also announced plans to join with the United States in funding a counter-terrorism police unit in Yemen, as well as plans to hold an international conference on Yemeni security later this month.\nEarlier today, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told the BBC, \"This is a new type of threat and it is from a new source which is obviously Yemen, but there are many other potential sources Somalia, as well as Afghanistan and Pakistan.\"\nEditor Hakim Almasmari, of the Yemen Post newspaper, thinks the conference might be advantageous if it results in more development projects for rural Yemen. However, he fears what any foreign-backed military attacks could mean. \n\"Al-Qaeda right now is not very strong,\" Almasmari said. \"Its followers are not more than 400 in all. However, if the U.S. does attack Yemen, al-Qaeda will get stronger and stronger because people who lose their families in the airstrikes will join al-Qaeda not because they want to but because they want revenge against the Americans and the Yemeni government for the attacks.\" \nThe situation has gained new urgency as the government in Sana'a finds itself overwhelmed not only by the growing terrorist threat, but also two separate rebellions, one of which has become something of a proxy war, at least in rhetoric, between Iran and Saudi Arabia.\nU.S. military experts have warned that vast reaches of the impoverished nation, with its booming population and dwindling resources, could spin permanently out of the government's control. \nMilitant groups from Somalia said that they would send fighters to help aid al-Qaeda in Yemen. Yemen has vowed to keep foreign extremists out.\nThe U.S. embassy has faced attacks from the local al-Qaeda group before, with an assault outside its gates in 2008 that left 19 people - civilians and militants - dead.

General Michael Flynn says U.S. intelligence efforts have focused too much on gathering information about insurgent groups in Afghanistan. \nHe says U.S. intelligence has been unable to inform U.S. and NATO forces about the environment in which they operate and the Afghan people whom they seek to persuade. His comments were published in a report issued Monday by a U.S. think tank, the Center for a New American Security.\nThe bodies of the seven CIA employees killed in the Khowst attack arrived Monday at a U.S. Air Force base in the East Coast state of Delaware. A small, private ceremony was held at the base, attended by friends and family and CIA Director Leon Panetta.\nThe bombing was the second-deadliest attack in the U.S. intelligence agency's history. In a statement, CIA spokesman George Little described the fallen employees as \"patriots who courageously served their nation.\"\nIn message to employees the day after the bombing, Panetta said, \"Those who fell yesterday were far from home and close to the enemy, doing the hard work that must be done to protect our country from terrorism.\"\nJordan's state news agency, Petra, identified the Jordanian officer killed in the bombing as Sharif Ali bin Zaid. It says he was killed while \"performing the sacred duty of Jordanian forces in Afghanistan.\" NATO says Jordan has seven troops in Afghanistan.\nNBC News says Bin Zaid was an intelligence agent and a first cousin of Jordan's King Abdullah II.

The body scanners cost 100,000 (112k, US$160k) a unit and they will be implemented at all six of BAA's controlled airports. This came after Prime Minister of the UK, Gordon Brown, said that he was committed to using the controversial technologies. \n\"We've recognised that there are new forms of weapon that are being used by al-Qaeda, so we've got to respond accordingly. We will do everything in our power to tighten up on the security that is essential,\" said Brown to BBC News. Critics have said that the scanners are ineffective and would not have detected the weapons used in the Christmas day attack, and that they would create airport delays.\nThe BAA released a statement saying \"It is our view that a combination of technology, intelligence and passenger profiling will help build a more robust defence against the unpredictable and changing nature of the terrorist threat to aviation,\".\nShami Chakrabarti, director of the civil liberties group Liberty, said that the BAA should not profile saying, \"Has no one noticed the terrorists' ability to capitalise on discrimination, or the recruits from a range of different backgrounds?

Travelers from all other nations will be searched randomly more often.\nThe targeted countries include Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya and Somalia. Other targeted countries were not revealed for security reasons.\nTSA spokeswoman Kristin Lee, said in a statement that the new measures go \"beyond simply looking at passports and now looks at itineraries from and through countries of interest...Because effective aviation security must begin beyond our borders, and as a result of extraordinary cooperation from our global aviation partners, TSA is mandating that every individual flying into the U.S. from anywhere in the world traveling from or through nations that are State sponsors of terrorism or countries of interest will be required to go through enhanced screening. The directive also increases the use of enhanced screening technologies and mandates threat-based and random screening for passengers on U.S. bound international flights.\"\nThe new regulations went into effect at midnight EST (05:00UTC) on January 4.\nThe Netherlands interior ministry announced December 30, 2009 that all passengers on commercial flights from the nation to the United States will have to be screened using the full body scanners. Originally U.S. officials advised Holland not to use such scanners due to privacy concerns, but now Guusje ter Horst said that \"all possible measures will be used on flights to the U.S.\" in the wake of recent events.\nNigeria will install full 3-D image scanners to all of its airports beginning this year.

Seven of the eight items were recovered, while an eighth made its way to an apartment in Dublin.  Slovak authorities realised on Tuesday that one package of explosives were missing and notified Irish authorities who searched the man's apartment.\nDuring the search, parts of Dublin's inner-suburbs were sealed off and evacuated causing disruption to residents and businesses.

The great fish was bought and then shared by the owners of a local sushi restaurant and a Hong Kong-based dining establishment. This tuna is the most expensive fish sold on record since 2001, when a 440-pound tuna was sold for over twenty-million ($220,000) at the very same market. \nWhen asked by local media outlets why he decided to purchase this giant tuna, the Hong Kong restaurateur said, \"I want[ed] to make an impact on the Japanese and Hong Kong economies by buying the highest-priced tuna.\"   \nThis locally caught tuna was among over two-thousand others bought and sold at this bustling fish market. Japan is the world's largest consumer of seafood per annum. With tuna being a major staple of their cuisine, the Japanese eat nearly eighty-percent of all commercially caught bluefin. \nHowever, tuna consumption in Japan has declined over recent years due to the change in the spending habits of its people as a result of economic downturns from the most recent recession.\n\"Consumers are shying away from eating tuna...We are very worried about the trend,\" a spokesperson for the Tsukiji market told the Associated Press. \nIn addition to the lack of demand and declining tuna stocks, fishermen and wholesalers worldwide are worried by the possibility of tighter fishing regulations that will be sanctioned and enforced by the Japanese government.  Despite this promise, many environmentalists say that this is not going far enough; they say that the only way to curb the inevitable extinction of the Pacific bluefin tuna is to initiate a trade ban on the fish altogether."}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [32, 2184, 287, 262, 10183, 14780, 18548, 261, 286, 520, 13, 7096, 268, 468, 10893, 257, 995, 1700, 26347, 3734, 286, 31011, 11, 830, 14780, 46754, 82, 357, 2937, 3, 24369, 11, 830, 8, 284, 262, 1171, 27517, 706, 340, 373, 4978, 319, 257, 2975, 290, 19584, 257, 1285, 2084, 13, 198, 32, 2184, 379, 6206, 468, 6149, 262, 14780, 1230, 287, 262, 10183, 636, 286, 262, 3240, 284, 1011, 2742, 2223, 1028, 663, 4870, 11, 262, 1748, 286, 978, 7012, 11, 284, 2245, 262, 26347, 3734, 13, 632, 318, 262, 3452, 2223, 287, 257, 2168, 284, 6878, 262, 14780, 1644, 329, 262, 26347, 3734, 13, 198, 198, 2202, 262, 3329, 286, 3321, 11, 2805, 860, 11, 262, 14780, 3334, 4281, 286, 4796, 357, 3398, 41, 828, 287, 6206, 11, 531, 326, 257, 2184, 287, 281, 10183, 14679, 11, 287, 543, 1644, 3790, 11, 11947, 389, 5047, 11, 714, 423, 12934, 329, 262, 26347, 38125, 13, 632, 561, 635, 423], "prefix_text": "A court in the eastern Swiss canton of St. Gallen has imposed a world record speeding fine of 299,000 Swiss francs (US$290,", "generated_result": {"0": "000) to the public purse after it was caught on a road and parked a week ago.\nA court at Bern has ordered the Swiss government in the eastern part of the town to take legal action against its owner, the city of Alba, to stop the speeding fine.

The contract was reported to have a value of 18,000,000 over the space of three years, however this has not been confirmed by the BBC.\nRoss, who has been working with the BBC since 1996, spoke to news reporters outside his house.  \"It's probably not a bad time for me to move on  and it's probably not a bad time for the BBC, either,\" he stated.  \"I've got six months left, I'm hoping to make the best shows of my career with them.\"  This information emerges one day after the announcement came that another BBC talk show host, Graham Norton, had signed a deal for two years with the BBC.  Rumours began to mount in the newspapers that Norton would soon take over Ross' television slot.  Alan Yentob, the BBC's Creative Director, said that \"[y]ou don't need to compare Graham with Jonathan Ross.  No decisions have been taken with that slot.\"  \nIn 2008, Ross was involved in the infamous incident involving Russell Brand and himself leaving obscene messages to actor Andrew Sachs via a voicemail service. Regarding his departure from the BBC, Jonathan said: \"Although I have had a wonderful time working for the BBC, and am very proud of the shows I have made while there, over the last two weeks I have decided not to re-negotiate when my current contract comes to an end. While there, I have worked with some of the nicest and most talented people in the industry and had the opportunity to interview some of the biggest stars in the world, and am grateful to the BBC for such a marvellous experience. I would like to make it perfectly clear that no negotiations ever took place and that my decision is not financially motivated. \n\"As I have said before  I would happily have stayed there for any fee they cared to offer, but there were other considerations.  I love making my Friday night talk show, my Saturday morning radio show and the Film Programme, and will miss them all.  Working at the BBC has been a tremendous privilege, and I would like to thank everyone who has watched and listened so loyally over the last 13 years.\""}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [464, 5018, 286, 4492, 468, 2714, 3482, 1393, 3965, 379, 657, 13, 20, 4, 329, 1194, 1227, 13, 383, 2494, 318, 262, 9016, 1683, 11, 290, 468, 6150, 287, 1295, 1201, 2805, 13, 198, 1722, 286, 2805, 3261, 11, 262, 1230, 550, 407, 1865, 4987, 284, 257, 362, 4, 2494, 2620, 13, 198, 198, 464, 5018, 338, 2494, 318, 3058, 379, 657, 4, 357, 15, 13, 23, 8, 290, 3793, 379, 281, 5079, 2494, 286, 532, 16, 4, 319, 3261, 2805, 11, 262, 5018, 338, 1459, 10273, 2494, 286, 657, 14, 16, 13, 198, 198, 818, 3090, 11, 262, 5018, 468, 407, 1865, 4987, 284, 257, 5969, 2494, 13, 198, 1212, 2494, 468, 407, 587, 4987, 284, 1201, 3269, 13, 198, 198, 818, 262, 5018, 338, 1570, 11, 612, 318, 645, 761, 284, 4043, 329, 597, 2252, 2223, 878, 262, 5018, 338, 2494, 481, 2620, 13, 632, 318, 262, 1230, 338, 6824, 284, 1745, 262, 5018, 286, 4492, 284, 663], "prefix_text": "The Bank of England has held UK interest rates at 0.5% for another month.

The Crimson Tide defeated the Longhorns 37-21.\nAfter a strong start by Texas, Alabama -- led by Greg McElroy -- went on the offense, leading by 24-6 at the end of the first half. Texas launched an impressive comeback bid to bring the score within three, but Alabama capitalized on two turnovers at the end of the fourth quarter to put the game away.\nFor the Crimson Tide, Ingram led all rushers with 116 yard and both he and Richardson had two touchdowns. For Texas Jordan Shipley led all receivers with 112 yards and two touchdowns. McElroy went 6/11 passing with 58 yards gained but was sacked several times. For Texas, Garrett Gilbert went 15/40 for 186 yards and two touchdowns, but was intercepted four times. On defense, Javier Arenas had two interceptions to lead all defenders.\nWith the win, Ingram became only the second Heisman winner to win the BCS national championship game in the same season. Also with the win, Alabama coach Nick Saban became the first coach to win two BCS national titles with two different schools. He previously won the title in 2003 with Louisiana State University.\nAfter the game, Ingram told ESPN that the national title has been a season-long goal for Alabama.\n\"The whole entire organization from the top to the bottom,\" Ingram said, \"we set that goal at the beginning at the season and worked towards it [...] I could not have done it by myself.\"\nIngram also told his father -- who is currently serving a prison sentence -- via the television broadcast that he loved him. Ingram's father played football for nine years in the NFL and was the 28th overall pick in the  1987 NFL Draft.\nOn the opening Texas possession, an injury to Texas starting quarterback Colt McCoy, who left the game, put true freshman Gilbert in charge of the Longhorn's offense.\nAfter the game, McCoy told ESPN that he \"[...] would haven given anything to be out there with [his] team.\"\nThe game, held annually in Pasadena, California, is the final college American football game in the country determines the national champion for the previous year's regular season. Both teams came into the game with perfect records and as the champions of their respective conferences, the SEC for Alabama and the Big 12 for Texas.\nFile:Colt McCoy - Fiesta Bowl - Jan 5 2009.jpg\nAfter winning the coin toss, Alabama elected to receive the ball. On fourth down in their first possession, Alabama attempted a fake punt, but Texas' Blake Giddeon intercepted the ball. A goal-line stop by Alabama forced a Texas field goal. However, the major news in Texas' first possession was an injury to Texas starting quarterback Colt McCoy, who left then game and later underwent X-rays on his right shoulder. McCoy was replaced by true freshman Garrett Gilbert. On the ensuing kickoff, Alabama again turns over the ball and Texas gets another field goal. In addition, Texas' defense came up strong, with three sacks in the first quarter.\nAlabama answered back on their next possession with a Mark Ingram touchdown to take the lead at the start of the second quarter. Alabama then forced a Texas three-and-out and received the ball on their own 47 yard line. The drive stalled after a sack of Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy and a Crimson Tide punt was taken by the Longhorn's Jordan Shipley at the Texas 15 yard line. Texas had no luck passing and had to punt, which Alabama returned to the Texas 51 yard line. On the second play from scrimmage, freshman Trent Richardson ran for a 49 yard touchdown, and after the extra point, a 14-6 Alabama lead.\nTexas hit back quickly with a 35-yard run to Alabama's 30 yard line and Gilbert went to the end zone with a pass, but the ball was dropped. Alabama got their first turnover of the game on a Gilbert interception on the next play, but could not capitalize, only managing to pin Texas within their five-yard-line on a punt. After two short runs, Gilbert could not hit Shipley for a first down pass, leaving Texas to punt. Alabama returned the punt to the Texas 29 yard line. Alabama kicker Leigh Tiffen hit a 26 yard field goal with 29 seconds left. However, the Tide were not done yet, as Marcell Dareus intercepted a Gilbert shovel pass and returned it 28 yards for the score and a 24-6 halftime lead.\nAt halftime, Texas coach Mack Brown told ESPN that he had chosen to go for a long field goal try to end the half and that the shovel pass was a routine one. Alabama coach Nick Saban told ESPN news that his team would not underestimate Texas in the second half, saying both teams needed to play 60 minutes of football. At the beginning of the second half, Brown told ESPN's Lisa Salters that McCoy would not return in the game.\nTexas received the ball first in the second half. After a first down, a Texas penalty forced a third-and-long, but Marquise Goodwin managed a 39-yard run for another first down. Texas could not advance the ball and punted into the end zone for a touchback. Texas' defence then forced a punt and received the ball at their own 34 yard line, before punting to Alabama who got the ball on their own 19 yard line. Texas then forced another punt, which Texas returned at the 47 yard line before punting again for an Alabama touchback. After a sack on McElroy, Alabama punted and Texas received on their 40 yard line. Texas finally broke the defensive battle when Gilbert hit Shipley for a 44 yard touchdown pass. After the extra point, Texas recovered on onside kick. Texas could not not get a first down, but managed to pin Alabama at their own 6 yard line as time wound down in the third quarter.\nAs the fourth quarter, the Crimson Tide marched down the field, helped by two personal fouls committed by Texas defenders. Kicker Leigh Tiffin then missed a 52 yard field goal, turning over the ball to Texas on downs. Gilbert hit several first downs and were helped by an Alabama penalty and Gilbert hit Shipley for another touchdown and a two-point conversion bringing Texas to within three points. On Alabama's ensuing possession, they are forced to punt and Texas gets the ball at the seven yard line.\nTexas' comeback bid was stopped when Gilbert was sacked and fumbled the ball, which Courtney Upshaw recovered for Alabama. Mark Ingram then scored on third down and Tiffin score the extra point. On the ensuing possession, Javier Arenas intercepted a Gilbert pass, which Alabama capitalized on with a one-yard Trent Richardson touchdown run. Tiffin's extra point attempt hit the upright to bring the score to 37-21. Texas could not respond as Gilbert was again intercepted.

This is now the third humanitarian agency, after CARE International and Doctors Without Borders, to evacuate from the war-torn nation. \nThe pull out, which will include the closing down of all UN offices and the withdrawal of all local staff, is going to effect over one million Somalismany of whom relay on this food program for their daily meals. \nWhen asked by the New York Times to further explain the UN's decision, Peter Smerdon, a spokesperson for the program, said via telephone from Nairobi, Kenya, \"In the past few weeks there has been a harder line of unacceptable demands and conditions set by armed groups (such as al-Shabaab) in these areas. We sadly had to make the decision to pull our staff out.\"\nSmerdon also cited the fact that over forty aid workers have been killed between January 2008 and September 2009, and that four volunteers still remain in the hands of their captors.\nFurthermore, when asked how this move by the UN will effect the Somali people, Smerdon said simply, \"People will go hungry...you could see malnutrition rates rising [as a result].\" When asked by a British newspaper, The Morning Star, the same question, another program representative, Emilia Casella, conveyed like sentiments, \"[Those] dependent on food assistance in southern Somalia face a situation that is particularly dire.\"\nIn a nation thatdue to civil warhas not had a functioning government in over two decades, Islamic extremists groupssuch as al-Shabaabas well as various warlords and pirate gangs control most of the Horn of Africa nation, except for its besieged capital, Mogadishu, which is protected by African Union and NATO troops in addition to UN peacekeepers.\nAccording to the UN, al-Shabaabwhich has direct influence over the area that is going to be effectedpresented their offices with numerous lists of demands. Among their demands was that the UN pay Shabaab a $20,000 protection fee every six months, seek Shabaab approval for all their projects, fire their entire female staff, and run their operations according to the militant group's schedule. \nWhen asked by The Associated Press about the UN's decision to leave southern Somaliaincluding his own town of JilibSomali civilian and father of eight children, Abdullahi Awnur, said that al-Shabaab is responsible for driving the UN food program away, and that what they are doing is \"indirect[ly] killing\" innocent people.\nAwnur went on to say, \"We have been forced to flee from our houses and depend on [UN] food aid, and now that it is finished, that means [al-Shabaab] here does not want us to live.\"\nDespite all that has been said, al-Shabaab spokesperson, Sheik Ali Mohamud Rage, told New York Times reporters that he found these claims to be \"baseless\" in their origins. He continued by stating that, \"All we (al-Shabaab) ordered them (the UN) was to buy food from Somali farmers and distribute it. They (the UN) do not want to do that, and because of that, they have made this very ridiculous justification.\" Nevertheless, the UN has noted that even when harvests were good, Somali farmers are only able to supply 30-40% of the food needed to sustain the bulk of the country's population. \n\"[Somalia] has been described as the most complex emergency in the world, and perhaps the most dangerous to operate in.

He was on business in Hiroshima at the time of the first bombing on August sixth. His almost direct exposure to the atomic explosion temporarily blinded him, ruptured his ear drum (leaving him permanently deaf in his left ear), and severely burnt the top half of his body. Three days later, having gone back to work in Nagasaki, he was approximately three kilometers away from the site of the second bomb. Although he was exposed to significant radiation in this instance as well, Mr. Yamaguchi was left relatively unscathed.\nFollowing Japan's surrender and the end of the War days later, Mr. Yamaguchi worked as a translator for the occupying American forces and later as a local schoolmaster, before eventually returning to Mitsubishiwhich had since then become an automobile manufacturer. \nIn his later years, Mr. Yamaguchi became a respected lecturer who gave talks about his experiences, and publicly spoke out against the stockpiling of nuclear weapons. \nFor instance, in 2006, he addressed the United Nations General Assembly. \"Having been granted this miracle, it is my responsibility to pass on the truth to the people of the world,\" Mr. Yamaguchi said to the Assembly.

The bacteria found was a form of fecal contamination, it was discovered, although it was not immediately clear whether it came from the soda fountains themselves, or people with dirty hands.\nOther bacteria were also found in the soda samples, including E.coli, present in eleven percent of the tested beverages. Many of the soda drinks apparently fell below the US Environmental Protection Agency's minimum standards for drinking water; regulations state that samples cannot test positive for E.coli bacteria. In total, 20% of soda fountains had more than the maximum recommended levels of bacteria.\n\"The large number of beverages and soda fountain machines containing E. coli is still of considerable concern [...] and suggests that more pathogenic strains of bacteria could persist and thrive in soda fountain machines if introduced,\" the authors of the study wrote.\nRenee Godard, the study's lead author, and a professor of biology and environmental studies at Hollins University, commented on the findings. \"Certainly we come in contact with bacteria all the time. It's simply that some bacteria may potentially cause some disease or gastrointestinal distress. One thing we hesitate with is that people get afraid of bacteria. Many of them are benign or helpful, but certainly, I don't want E.coli in my beverage,\" she said.\nGodard and her team took samples of 90 different beverages from three groups - sugar soda, diet soda, water - from 30 fast-food restaurants in Roanoke, Virginia.\n\"You can get collections of bacteria in the water line and that then runs through the whole machine and gets in to the beverage. Any time any water or liquid sits somewhere, it's just a breeding ground for bacteria,\" commented Primary Care Physician Alanna Levine.\nExperts suggest that plastic nozzles used on soda fountains might be part of the reason why the study found so much bacteria is present; it takes only a single dirty hand to spread bacteria over a tube, and it could be easily transferred to the rest of the fountain from there. \n\"It could be from dispensing with a hand that wasn't clean or using wet rags to wipe down the machine. We haven't done the work to really identify those potential sources and how these bacteria get established,\" Godard said.\nA professor at the University of California Davis, however, said he believed that a single localised study wasn't enough to come to a conclusion about soda machines throughout the country. \"How sanitation regulations are promulgated and enforced in a community are different. Some communities are more on to it than others. How much of a threat it represents? It's probably limited. Once again, it's a matter of what regulations are in place, who pays attention and whether it's being followed,\" he said, as quoted by CNN.\nThe National Restaurant Association responded to the university's findings in an e-mail statement. \"While the results of this study are disconcerting, we feel that it isn't representative of our industry and that our guests can safely enjoy beverages from dispensers and single-serve containers alike,\" the organisation said.\nThe American Beverage Association also countered the findings. \"Fountain beverages are safe.

As a result, there is now a surplus of vaccines.\nDavid Salisbury, the Department of Health's director of immunisation, said that it hasn't yet been decided what to do with the UK's surplus of vaccine, although talks are underway. \"We have to keep a stockpile for ourselves because we simply don't know what is going to happen over 2010, and we know that there are proportions even within the risk group who have not been vaccinated.

After multiple attempts to fix the problem failed, the pilot decided that an emergency landing was the only remaining choice.\nOnly the plane's nose gear and left landing gear had descended. The right landing gear would not release. The airliner made a go-around as the crew attempted to fix the problem. Passenger Jim Falk knew something was wrong saying, \"Normally a big plane like that doesn't do a bypass, so we knew something was wrong.\" \nHowever, the pilot decided that nothing could be done to bring the gear down, and an emergency landing was declared.  \"We are going to have an unusual landing,\" the pilot calmly announced to the 53 passengers seated on the plane, according to passenger Moritz Loew. Another passenger, Paul Lasiuk said he was more shocked than scared, telling himself, \"You have no choice.  You're going to go through this.\"\n\"Brace! Brace! Brace!\", the pilot announced over the plane's public address system, calling for passengers to enter the brace position as the plane made a touchdown on the runway at Newark. The plane touched down on the nose wheel and left rear wheel before lurching to the right causing sparks to fly as the right engine skidded along the runway. Eventually, the plane came to stop at 9:27 A.M. EDT.\nAfterward, passengers and crew evacuated the plane by sliding down the evacuation slides and moving quickly away from the plane. They were then taken by bus to the airline's lounge where they told their stories to investigators and waited for their luggage. Three passengers reported minor injuries but refused treatment.\nThe emergency landing caused the airport to shut down for 20 minutes, but service quickly resumed on two of the airports three runways. The plane remained on the runway throughout the afternoon as investigators determined the cause of the landing gear failure. \nThis is in contrast to last week, when the airport was shutdown for six hours after a young man named Haisong Jiang breached security by passing through an exit to kiss his girlfriend goodbye.\nAccording to passengers, the crew remained calm during the ordeal. Jim Falk said, \"They did a great job. There was no yelling, screaming, panicking or anything.\" Falk said he wanted to buy a bottle of champagne for the currently unnamed pilot. Falk added, \"The pilot did a beautiful job. He didnt put it in the water like the other pilot did, but he should be commended.\" \nMartin Trebino, a spokesperson for United Airlines said they would not release the pilot's name on Sunday, but did not indicate when his name would be made available either.\nPaul Lasiuk said, \"I've had a lot of worse landings at Newark before. It was unbelievably smooth.\"\nMoritz Loew joked with himself afterward saying, \"What's a great landing? One that you walk away from.\"\nThe flight, which left Chicago's O'Hare International Airport early Sunday morning around 6 A.M. reported no other problems during the flight up until the incident. According to United Airlines spokesperson Robin Urbanski, it remains unclear why the landing gear failed to deploy. Urbanski added that passengers' tickets would be refunded and that they would receive vouchers and credit towards any future flight."}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [3260, 257, 845, 1969, 5859, 3344, 3690, 262, 983, 11, 262, 7943, 18071, 9772, 262, 3469, 4696, 17832, 6885, 12, 2231, 287, 281, 17820, 32251, 1909, 287, 262, 4295, 2657, 2835, 286, 262, 24004, 3687, 13, 198, 3260, 257, 845, 890, 1110, 379, 262, 5134, 12082, 319, 3035, 2534, 11, 262, 18071, 4721, 262, 3218, 1622, 1028, 262, 17832, 13, 198, 464, 717, 2063, 286, 262, 983, 373, 257, 5802, 290, 2408, 530, 326, 373, 13354, 416, 4705, 15196, 88, 355, 262, 6907, 373, 4137, 284, 35363, 290, 262, 3761, 373, 2957, 351, 691, 2237, 5341, 1364, 13, 198, 464, 983, 373, 8165, 379, 513, 12, 18, 351, 362, 2431, 5637, 287, 262, 717, 21676, 11, 475, 262, 17832, 547, 1498, 284, 651, 262, 4776, 379, 767, 25, 1270, 13, 2080, 262, 983, 8165, 513, 290, 379, 262, 886, 340, 373, 640, 284, 1445, 319, 290, 711, 262, 983, 13, 198, 3260, 262, 983, 314, 373, 1364, 351, 257, 4203], "prefix_text": "After a very close offensive battle throughout the game, the Arizona Cardinals defeated the Green Bay Packers 51-45 in an overtime thriller today in the wild card round of", "generated_result": {"0": " the NFC East.\nAfter a very long day at the NFL combine on April 22, the Cardinals opened the regular season against the Packers.\nThe first half of the game was a tough and difficult one that was dominated by Matt Nagy as the offense was forced to punt and the defense was led with only six plays left.\nThe game was tied at 3-3 with 2 minutes remaining in the first OT, but the Packers were able to get the score at 7:30.

The game was won after Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers fumbled the ball during overtime, resulting in Arizona's Karlos Dansby recovering the ball and returning it for a touchdown, giving the Cardinals the sudden death victory. Arizona coach Ken Whisenhunt called the contest \"...Probably one of the best games ever played in the playoffs\", while Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy said that it was \"The toughest loss I've ever been a part of.\" Both team's strong offenses were evident throughout the entire game. The two team's offensive totals combined to reach a massive 1,024 yards, with the Cardinals gaining 531 and the Packers 493. \nIn the first quarter, the Cardinals got out to a quick start, when cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie intercepted an errant Rodgers throw and returned it for a touchdown. On Green Bay's very next possession, wide receiver Donald Driver fumbled, setting up another quick Arizona touchdown and making the score 14-0 in favor of the Cardinals. An Arizona field goal by Neil Rackers made it a 17-0 lead at the end of the first quarter.\nThe Packers began to show some of their offensive firepower in the second quarter. To start the quarter, Rodgers led the team down the field in a 52-yard drive that lead to a Rodgers sneak at the goal line to give the Packers their first points of the game. However, the Cardinals quickly countered with a scoring drive of their own, capped off by a 15-yard passing touchdown from quarterback Kurt Warner to receiver Early Doucet. At the end of the half, Green Bay kicked a field goal to cut into the deficit which was still quite large, a 24-10 halftime edge for Arizona. \nWarner and Rodgers both showed explosive passing throughout the next half. In the third, both quarterbacks threw two touchdown passes to make the score 38-24, the Cardinals still holding the edge. Green Bay began to mount their comeback in the fourth quarter. They began with two touchdowns, tying the game at 38. Warner again countered with another passing score for Arizona, giving them a one touchdown edge with under 3 minutes to play. Then, Rodgers led the Packers in a quick drive, scoring and tying the game at 45 all. The match now had to be decided in overtime.\nGreen Bay won the overtime coin toss, giving them the advantage of having the ball first in the sudden death period. However, the key mistake of the game came here. On the Packers' third play, Aaron Rodgers fumbled, creating a Karlos Dansby recovery which he returned for a touchdown, ending the offensive shootout with a final score of 51-45.\nAfter the win, Arizona is now focused on advancing further in the playoffs, as well as rumors on Warner's possible retirement. \"I don't think you every want to stay too long, but you never want to go out before it's time,\" said Warner. \"The hard part is trying to figure that out, but right now it's about another playoff game.

The highlighted comment made by Reid was calling Obama a \"light-skinned\" black man \"with no Negro dialect unless he wanted to have one.\" The remarks were released in a book co-written by Time magazine reporter Mark Halperin, and New York magazine reporter John Heileman. \nReid has since apologized for \"using such a poor choice of words.\"  President Obama quickly accepted the apology.  Reid has been a partner with the Obama Administration on issues such as health care reform.  Democratic Party chairman Tim Kaine told Meet the Press \"the comments were unfortunate and they were insensitive\", but \"I think the case is closed because President Obama has spoken directly with the leader [Reid] and accepted his apology. [...] We're moving on.\"\nMembers of the Republican Party have called on Reid to resign over his comments. Party chairperson Michael Steele told Fox News Sunday \"There is this standard where the Democrats feel that they can say these things and they can apologize when it ... comes from the mouths of their own. But if it comes from anyone else, it's racism,\". Having appeared alongside Kaine, where the Democrat Party chairman stated the case was closed, Steele argued that there was a double standard, on the basis of then-Senator Obama calling in 2002 calling for Trent Lott, at that time the majority leader, to be ousted for supporting the views of Strom Thurmond, who stood as a segregationist Presidential candidate in 1948.\nThe book Game Change published today, also says that New York Senator Chuck Schumer encouraged Barack Obama to run in early 2006, even though he later endorsed his former colleague Hillary Clinton.

In late 2008, Daily Kos reporter Jed Lewison drew attention to comments by Halpern, on-stage with Heilmen, asserting the reportage was, \"extreme bias, extreme pro-Obama coverage\"; he characterised election coverage as, \"the most disgusting failure of people in our business since the Iraq war\".

To this end, Google states that they are \"currently in the process of notifying these companies,\" and they are cooperating with the \"relevant authorities.\"\nDrummond goes on to say that through a separate and unrelated investigation, Google has additionally discovered that the accounts of \"dozens\" of Gmail users worldwide who are \"advocates\" of political and human rights in China \"appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties\" as well.\nHowever, he affirms that \"...these accounts have not been accessed through any security breach at Google, but most likely via phishing scams or malware placed on the users computers.\"\nAs a result of what has occurred here, Google said it has already made significant changes to the security infrastructure of its users' accounts as to prevent something like this from ever happening again.\nAt the same time, Google advised individual users to use more discretion while online, \"We would advise people to deploy reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on their computers, to install patches for their operating systems and to update their web browsers. Always be cautious when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and emails, or when asked to share personal information like passwords.\"\n\nGoogle launched its Chinese-language search engine, Google.cn, in January 2006. The only precondition to operating in China was that the company had to acquiesce to certain censorship demands from the one-party government. When defending their controversial rationale for operating in the socialist republic, Google said \"that the benefits of increased access to information for people in China, and a more open Internet outweighed our discomfort in agreeing to censor some results.\" \nNevertheless, Google has still been widely criticized for this voluntary censorship of search results of topics, such as the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, movements for Tibetan and Taiwan independence, and the Falun Gong religious movement along with other information considered harmful to the Chinese government. Some feel it goes against and is hypocritical of Google's informal motto, \"Don't be evil\".\nIn response, a spokesperson for the Chinese Consulate in New York City, Wenqi Gao, said in a phone interview to The New York Times, I want to reaffirm that China is committed to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign companies in our country.\nIn contrast, Sharon Hom, the executive director of Human Rights in China said, \"It's a wakeup call for the international community about the risks of doing business in China. The tendency has been for companies to keep their eye just on the benefits of doing business. But the risks are realThe risks are to our intellectual property. The risks are to our values.\"\nAnalysts noted that this move has the potential to financially hurt Google, which has a somewhat limited share of the Internet search market in China, which is dominated by the Chinese-based Google-like website Baidu. Google's shares fell just under two percent after hours to US$579.50. Meanwhile, Baidu shares rose five percent to US$406.\nHarvard Business School professor David Yoffie said, \"The consequences of not playing the China market could be very big for any company, but particularly for an Internet company that makes its money from advertising.\"\n\"It will hurt their profits. They get eight to ten percent of their revenues from China,\" said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst for Global Equities Research. \"If they walk, they will eventually be invited back into China, because the Chinese people will request that. Openness always wins, but it will take some time.\"\nTim Ghriskey, the chief investment officer for Solaris Asset Management said, \"Clearly not good news for Google and clearly not good news for consumers. You've got to think that eventually Google figures out a way to deal with this. If they do have to shut down their Chinese operations, that they would be able to reinstate them. Hopefully soon. I can't imagine that this would be permanent.\" He added, \"China is a great growth engine for every business. It is a great opportunity for Google as well.\"\nIn response to all that has happened and what has been said, Drummond explains that this has \"led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China.\"\nHe goes on to state, \"We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.\"\nDrummond concludes his statement by trying to assuage the situation the best he can, \"The decision to review our business operations in China has been incredibly hard, and we know that it will have potentially far-reaching consequencesWe are committed to working responsibly to resolve the very difficult issues raised.\""}, {"ended": true, "tokens": [16220, 435, 1462, 46909, 38656, 2137, 11, 39206, 11, 290, 26777, 286, 29388, 8159, 4502, 7164, 38336, 3724, 9722, 5441, 812, 938, 3321, 379, 257, 4436, 287, 509, 8847, 77, 375, 283, 21553, 72, 290, 465, 14825, 373, 6157, 416, 3394, 43923, 396, 290, 5240, 2564, 11, 14840, 509, 5117, 709, 13, 198, 7, 2969, 8, 357, 2969, 5555, 14, 49, 1077, 21862, 15688, 8], "prefix_text": "Russian alto saxophone player, conductor, and composer of Armenian origin George Garanian died aged 75 years last Monday at a hospital in Krasnodar", "generated_result": {"0": " Krai and his funeral was performed by Russian pianist and arranger, Vladimir Karpov.\n(AP) (AP Photo/Rashkovsky)"}, "prompt": "Russian alto saxophone player, conductor, and composer of Armenian origin George Garanian died aged 75 years last Monday at a hospital in Krasnodar", "gen_text": "Russian alto saxophone player, conductor, and composer of Armenian origin George Garanian died aged 75 years last Monday at a hospital in Krasnodar Krai and his funeral was performed by Russian pianist and arranger, Vladimir Karpov.\n(AP) (AP Photo/Rashkovsky)", "reference_text": "Russian alto saxophone player, conductor, and composer of Armenian origin George Garanian died aged 75 years last Monday at a hospital in Krasnodar, where he planned some concerts together with Michel Legrand and a city big band.\nGeorge Garanian was born in 1934 in Moscow.

The European Court of Human Rights deemed powers contained in the Terrorism Act 2000 denied the human right of privacy.\nUnder the European Convention of Human Rights people in the UK are granted the right to privacy, although their government felt that the threat of terrorism meant that the breach of this was justifiable and allowable under exemptions in the Convention. Previously, the powers have been unsuccessfully challenged before the English and Welsh High Court, upheld by those nations' Court of Appeals and finally upheld again before the UK's House of Lords.\nSection 44 of the Terrorism Act allows the Home Secretary to designate an area for use of the powers for a certain period. If this period was more than a month then at the end of the month then the Home Secretary can renew them. The entirety of Greater London has spent several years with the powers in effect. Under the Act, the police do not need to have any reason to search whoever they like and have the power to confiscate articles they believe to be of use to terrorists. They can also make arrests if these are found.\nYesterday's ruling was made in a case brought by Kevin Gillan and Pennie Quinton, both stopped outside a military exhibition in London's Docklands area. Gillan was stopped while cycling past and kept there for twenty minutes while journalist Quinton was ordered to stop filming even after showing her press card. She claims to have been detained for roughly thirty minutes at the scene, while police claim she was there for five minutes. The court awarded 33,850 (30,400) to cover the costs incurred by bringing the case.\nUK Home Secretary Alan Johnson expressed disappointment at the ruling and stated that an appeal will be launched. Chief Constable Craig Mackey of the Association of Chief Police Officers said that while this appeal was pending Section 44 of the Act would continue to be used  by police.\nThe court found that the humiliation and embarrassment of searching  people in public was a clear breach of privacy as well as criticising that the way power was authorised did not require a test that its use be \"necessary,\" merely \"expedient.\" The court singled out London's designation under the Act as an area where the powers could be used continuously since it became law as an example of why this was not appropriate.\nFurther criticism in the ruling was aimed at the idea that the decision to search could be \"based exclusively on the 'hunch' or 'professional intuition' of the police officer\". The judgement added that \"the absence of any obligation on the part of the officer to show a reasonable suspicion made it almost impossible to prove that the power had been improperly exercised,\" with no judicial oversight. Racism was a further concern, with the court expressing a fear that the powers could easily be used in a discrimminatory manner.

However, that found on curvy bums, thighs and hips actually traps fatty acids, as well as being associated with a reduced risk of diabetes and heart conditions. It releases hormones that help control blood sugar levels and keep arteries in good condition by preventing blockages with an anti-inflammatory. \nBelly fat releases inflammatory substances called cytokines and it is these that are trapped by the fat on curvy hips, bottoms and thighs. Cytokines also latch upon muscles and the liver, and can cause resistance to insulin, an important chemical. A lack of fat in the areas identified can also lead to metabolic chaos such as that which occurs in Cushing's syndrome.\n\"The idea that body fat distribution is important to health has been known for some time,\" explained Manolopoulos \"However is it only very recently that thigh fat and a larger hip circumference have been shown to promote health, that lower body fat is protective by itself.\" He stated that future research might even seek ways to ensure people have a healthy layer of fatty curves and that further study may be required to better understand the health effects."}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [32, 12170, 1368, 11, 9885, 284, 423, 587, 925, 416, 1294, 3386, 11, 2923, 379, 1551, 14104, 661, 290, 6686, 257, 2252, 29167, 287, 48164, 7648, 2961, 1909, 11, 3584, 617, 3136, 423, 635, 5220, 517, 18499, 547, 379, 262, 640, 286, 262, 3434, 290, 617, 547, 2098, 284, 1282, 422, 262, 17807, 5428, 13, 770, 318, 780, 262, 12170, 1368, 550, 587, 5281, 503, 1028, 257, 9885, 7417, 1448, 11, 7648, 338, 2422, 531, 13, 198, 198, 1212, 989, 373, 3199, 319, 262, 7648, 6714, 3000, 319, 3321, 3329, 13, 383, 989, 373, 1912, 319, 257, 2643, 1813, 379, 663, 7664, 286, 262, 2422, 338, 4905, 1028, 262, 9885, 3246, 1368, 13, 366, 1858, 318, 645, 2370, 11, 4249, 2370, 422, 597, 286, 777, 3434, 11, 326, 262, 17807, 5428, 318, 4497, 329, 262, 1368, 553, 262, 3348, 2098, 284, 6714, 25804, 13, 785, 13, 198, 198, 464, 1368, 319, 262, 9885, 7417, 287, 8528, 5374, 1812, 550, 407], "prefix_text": "A drone attack, suspected to have been made by US forces, killed at least twelve people and injured a further fourteen in northwestern Pakistan earlier today, although some reports", "generated_result": {"0": " have also suggested more casualties were at the time of the attacks and some were reported to come from the Pakistani army.

However, unlike the majority of the other stations on both digital and FM, Amazing Radio doesn't play normal, mainstream music.  Instead, its playlist consists solely of music from unsigned bands and artists who have signed up and uploaded their music to AmazingTunes.com.  Their music can then be downloaded from the site, for which they get paid.  The more downloads and interest an artist receives, the more likely they are to get played on the national radio station.  Amazing markets itself as an \"ethical\" download website, on which artists get 70% of the download revenues.  They now have more than 22,000 songs uploaded, with about 100 uploaded every day.  \nPaul Campbell himself has extensive experience in both radio and television production, having worked for BBC Radio 4 and Channel 4.  After success with his own production company in the nineties and with support from investors, Campbell launched Amazing Tunes in 2005.\nAs Amazing Radio introduces a new schedule for the New Year, with presenters rather than solely pre-recorded links, Wikinews reporter Tristan Thomas interviewed Campbell to find out more.\n((Wikinews)) Hi Paul, thanks for doing this interview.\n((Paul Campbell)) My pleasure  thanks very much for asking me.  Were really grateful that Wikinews is interested in us.\n((WN)) At the end of 2009, you complained to the BBC Trust about BBC Introducing.  Can you explain what this was about and the reasons for it.  Has anything come of it?\n((PC)) Sure: in a nutshell, the complaint was about unfair competition - about the BBC not following its own rules.  Its still ongoing. It will take, ahem, a while to resolve. \nThe details are a bit complex, but here goes.  (If you commit suicide out of the boredom at what follows, I apologise). \nAs British readers will know, the BBC has a guaranteed and very comfortable income derived from the Licence Fee - effectively a tax you have to pay if you want a TV.  According to Wikipedia (so it must be true), this generates an income to the BBC of about stg4.5bn per annum.  Nice. \nNot really.  In recent years the beeb has increasingly used this gargantuan income - and its incredible audience reach online, on radio & TV - to launch new services that make life impossible for everyone who is not the BBC.  These have ranged from e-learning content (that completely wrecked the market for private publishers), to a new digital radio station (that caused a private speech station to go bust), to an attempt to launch online regional news services (which caused howls of outrage from local newspapers).  The BBC does it for the best of reasons  to provide a public service  but BBC people live in an insulated, publicly-funded world, one where you know with complete certainty youll get paid on the 15th of every month. Its a million miles away from the real world, where entrepreneurial people take risks, and lose their jobs and their houses if it goes wrong.  Here, the BBCs actions have grave implications.  And not just for private companies: the UK as a whole is very good at creative industries, which are the fastest-growing part of the economy. But its kinda hard to grow a global business if your domestic market has been wrecked by a rampaging, publicly-funded, bull in a china shop.  So by accidentally knackering private companies, the BBC is also damaging the British economy.  \nWise people noticed this.  A few years ago the Governance of the BBC was changed.  A new regulator, the BBC Trust, was created.  It tried to address the problem.  It insists the Corporation does a 'public value test' when it wants to launch a new service, or to expand an existing one.\nHere, it hasn't.  Although the BBC has a longstanding commitment to play new music on its local radio stations, and one of its most famous DJs John Peel had an outstanding show on BBC Radio 1 for many years which played new music (and was, incidentally, produced by one of our new presenters), it's suddenly changed the game.  Its launched a huge expansion and automation of this formerly piecemeal and limited activity, targeted exclusively at unsigned bands. BBC Introducing is a pan-BBC brand, combining local and network radio, television, online, even a special stage at Glastonbury.  There's a very expensive online upload service which I just know would have cost ten times what we had to spend on our similar service. There's a Head of Department, doubtless with dozens of staff.  Ill bet they have BBC Introducing pens.  It's everywhere. \nThis is, by any reckoning, a new service.  But its not been subjected to a public value test.  Worse, I have it on very good authority from someone inside the BBC that BBC Worldwide - its commercial arm - is planning to launch a BBC Introducing record label  i.e., an overtly commercial expansion of BBC Introducing.  This would be like the BBC trying to create a new version of the music industry, all by itself.  \nWhether or not you think it's a good thing for the beeb to champion new music, you may agree it should follow its own rules.  It hasnt.  There was no Public Value Test; no request to the Trust to be allowed to do this. \nSo we complained.  It was a bit hilarious.  The Trust said they weren't allowed to investigate until we'd complained to the beeb itself and the BBC had rejected our complaint.  There was a long pause as I tried to understand the logic.  I said Im guessing the BBC didnt do a PVT because it didnt think it needed to do a PVT.  We think they should have done.  Were asking you to investigate, to see if you agree.  They said you have to complain to them first.  Its protocol. It's all very British - i.e., charmingly polite  ludicrously bureaucratic  and totally useless.   \nSo we have another hoop to jump through. We're now preparing our formal complaint to the BBC itself - whose Director General is someone I used to work with, when we were both fresh-faced BBC trainees in 1981.  It takes time: Ill have to write it myself, and I have a business to run.  The beeb will have a small army of staff whose only job is to read it  and reject it.  (They always reject criticism; it's the BBC's default position.  They usually do it with a slightly pained expression, hurt that anyone could fail to understand their brilliance and omniscience.  Either that, or they try to demolish your intellect and cast doubt on your probity.  Either way, they'll reject it).  \nWhen they do, we'll then be able to go back to the BBC Trust to say guess what?  The BBC rejected our complaint. Now will you investigate?. Yawn. \nAll this might make me seem a BBC-hater.  Actually nothing could be further from the truth.  The BBC trained me.  I was once, so I was told by the Head of Appointments, its youngest-ever Producer.  Despite appearances, I firmly believe it's one of the best things about the UK.  I wrote to The Times of London recently in defence of it. But unfortunately it's really, really bad at understanding the damage it does to private companies, the ones like ours that create jobs and try to create wealth, without the benefit of a guaranteed income.  (Or even, any income at all).  \nThe stakes are high.  The conventional music industry is falling to bits around us. Theres an historic opportunity to re-invent music in a way that's fair to musicians and music-lovers, and also creates jobs and wealth in the real economy. It's vitally important the BBC, with its publicly-funded hobnailed boots, doesn't ruin that opportunity. \nSo well do our complaint, wait for it to be rejected, complain to the Trust, and keep battering away. Fun fun fun.  (This would never happen in the States). \n((WN)) You don't accept any PRS registered artists at all.  Why not? \n((PC)) Wed love to  after all, we have the same aim as PRS, which is to make it easier for musicians to earn a living from their talent.  But we cant.  Theres two reasons. \nI wrote to the CEO of PRS when we first launched Amazing Radio pointing out these absurdities and asking if we could do a more intelligent deal.  I said that I thought we had identical aims  to make life fair for musicians.  I suggested we could/should be a feeder to them, introducing new members to PRS as they grew in the music industry.  But so far, the PRS head is still firmly in the sand.\n((WN)) And how would you suggest PRS could improve?  If they did, would you consider allowing artists registered with them? \n((PC)) PRS could improve by;  \nIf they did that, wed sign up.  This would not necessarily be popular with our audience.  A lot of people  especially charities and small businesses  like the fact that they can listen to Amazing Radio without a PRS licence.  But wed do it anyway, as it would be a better service for musicians.  \nMy personal view is that the PRS should also stop threatening to murder law-abiding people who want to listen to music at work.  There was a recent case where they threatened someone for singing at work.  They actually did that.  They later apologized, but it revealed the corporate mentality.  I think its incredibly counter-productive; it means their members make less money, not more; its ruining perceptions of what motivates musicians; its causing thousands of people to stop listening to music.  When really, PRS should be encouraging that, shouldnt it? \n((WN)) With regard to Amazing Tunes, how many downloads could your most popular artist expect to receive per month and monetary wise, how would this compare to them receiving that number from iTunes?\n((PC)) Sorry, but we dont currently release detailed figures  our competitors would love it, but wed rather be nice to our artists and our investors instead. We do say that we expect amazingtunes.com artists to make anything from a few quid, to a good living, to a small fortune.  At the moment, because its still very early days, people are clustered towards the first two of those options.  As things grow  and theres been incredible growth even in the past few months  we hope/expect more and more artists will start to make tens of thousands of pounds each month.  Well soon register for the official chart, and our guess is that someone will have a major hit before long. Then everything will go really crazy. \nSo far as the iTunes comparisons go, the facts are already public domain. An artist on iTunes can expect to make 8p from a 79p download.  The same artist on amazingtunes.com will make about 52p.  We only deduct the VAT and the cost of the transaction: 70% of whats left goes to the artist.  Whats more, their income will improve over time - the more downloads we sell, the less the transactions cost us, so the more cash there is to give to the artists.  Thats one reason we ask people to buy eight or more songs in one transaction  its much more cost-effective, less of their cash goes to VISA, more to the artist.  (See my Blog post on this here - [1]). \n((WN)) Amazing Radio launched in mid-2009.  How has it grown since then and what are your current listening figures?\n((PC)) Its gone mad since then.  Ive worked in broadcasting and the media since 1978 (I was very very young then, mind you).  Ive never known anything like it.  The reaction has been absolutely incredible  and its growing faster than ever right now.  The most humbling thing has been the audience feedback  masses of long emails from people weve never met, saying they found it by accident, and they love it.\nWeve not yet paid for RAJAR audience figures because  well, because were a bit mean really, and Im not convinced they would accurately measure our audience.  I think RAJAR is very good at coming out with figures for radio stations that have been going for 40 years, but not very accurate when it comes to new and innovative stations which are also listened to a lot online and especially popular with young people.  But the best guess Ive heard in the industry is that we have something like 600,000 listeners in the UK on DAB.  Thats an estimate, but it came from a very wise source.  We have slightly more than that number on top as regular users online, and a weekly reach for amazingtunes.com of about two million users. But its all growing so fast, those numbers will be out of date by the time you read this. \n((WN)) DAB transmission costs are well over half a million pounds a year.  How is this being funded currently and how are you planning to fund it in the future?\n((PC)) Were not contractually allowed to tell you what we pay, so we cant confirm or deny the cost.   Whatever the true figure, it is undeniably expensive; but it gives our musicians a chance to be on national radio. We figure its worth it.  Im reminded of that wonderful teachers union bumper sticker: if you think educations expensive, try ignorance.   If you think creating the worlds first radio station playing 100% new music is expensive . try being inaudible. \nSo far, weve been funded by a very small number of private investors, people of enormous wisdom and insight, natch. They understand that we have a very serious, long-term and audacious ambition to change the music industry for the better, to make radio interesting again, and to turn the word amazing into a global challenger brand.   \nThis year, we expect to do one final fund-raising in the UK, then to raise a lot of money on the West Coast of the USA to make this absolutely massive and global, fast.  They understand this scale of ambition there.   \n((WN)) What are your plans for Amazing Radio in 2010?  Any exciting announcements to come?\n((PC)) Fraid so. \nIn 2010, we hope to make Amazing Radio the default station for everyone who has ever had that incredible experience of hearing a song for the first time, and having to stop what youre doing to listen to it: a station for everyone who has broad musical tastes, a respect for musical talent and an open mind.  We want it to be constantly surprising, fresh, original, sometimes hilarious, always unexpected.  \nBlimey, I sound like some corporate twat.   \nNow (obviously) it wouldnt be massively unexpected if we suddenly started revealing all the unexpected things in advance  but basically, wed like the message to spread that were doing something different, fresh, original and ethical - so well launch more new programmes and more new services  on Amazing Radio and amazingtunes.com.  Things like our virtual radio station Amazing Ambient.   [2].  Therell be some video and some TV along soon too.   And other cool stuff.   \nIt may not be insanely cool; just cool will do just fine. \nWe also want to do it in other places.  E.g. America. Weve already started there. Well be unexpected there too. \n((WN)) Finally, your favourite artist on Amazing Tunes/Radio at the moment?\n((PC)) Now this will sound like a real cop-out, but I never ever say who my favourite artist is.  Its for a serious reason. Im not some musical Einstein - Im merely the bloke who started amazing.  And Im merely a drummer. My taste doesnt matter. EVERYBODYs musical taste does.  One of the many problems of conventional record companies is that they think geezers in suits in big glass buildings have the right to decide whats good music.  We think the world does. Ive found hundreds of incredible songs that I love, across loads of styles of music.  Youll find hundreds of your own.  Enjoy. \n((WN)) Thank you very much for your time Paul.  Good luck for 2010.\n((PC)) Thanks very much, we really appreciate it. 2010 is going to be amazing."}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [50, 380, 44824, 272, 32519, 10099, 449, 13, 311, 13, 309, 747, 391, 323, 363, 321, 11, 508, 373, 11897, 284, 1160, 812, 287, 3770, 938, 614, 11, 468, 587, 2716, 319, 3321, 13, 198, 198, 50, 380, 44824, 272, 2056, 2098, 326, 449, 13, 311, 13, 468, 587, 1813, 257, 1936, 812, 6827, 329, 34638, 257, 2576, 319, 1737, 2534, 11, 1584, 13, 554, 428, 1339, 11, 262, 2415, 373, 9722, 1022, 1315, 290, 1679, 290, 373, 16110, 319, 262, 976, 1110, 290, 757, 319, 2901, 352, 11, 1584, 357, 1169, 3128, 262, 2576, 550, 587, 2923, 737, 198, 198, 464, 2576, 373, 788, 13125, 510, 287, 7356, 290, 16110, 329, 1115, 1528, 706, 262, 7262, 13, 198, 464, 2184, 2982, 326, 287, 262, 1339, 11, 262, 7262, 263, 447, 247, 82, 3656, 550, 587, 16110, 319, 262, 6180, 286, 326, 1110, 290, 757, 262, 1110, 290, 640, 262, 2576, 373, 13125, 510, 13, 198, 2202, 262, 1110, 286], "prefix_text": "Sri Lankan Tamil journalist J.

El-Faisal was recently released from a British prison where he spent the last four years of his life for his role in various terrorist plots, including the July 2005 London Bombings.\nAfter being refused entry to his native Jamaica in addition to several East African nations, el-Faisal entered Kenya on December 24, 2009 after having gone via Nigeria, Angola, Mozambique, Swaziland, Malawi, and Tanzania.  Kenyan authorities arrested him after he was red-flagged in an immigration database.  \nWhat was at first a peaceful protest by youth members of a local group known as the Muslim Human Rights Forum soon turned violent as the demonstrators started to pelt riot police with stones and other objects.  In turn, officers retaliated at first with tear gas and water cannons, but as matters further deteriorated and some protesters attempted to stab them, the officers began to employ live ammunition, firing it into the crowd. \nLater in the day as the situation continued to deteriorate, scores of uninvolved civiliansfor reasons still unknown by the mediagot into the scuffle on the side of the police. \nFurthermore, shops adjacent to where the protest was taking place were looted and vehicles that were parked on the streets were totalled in the midst of all that was transpiring.\nAt a news conference blocks away, government spokesperson Alfred Mutua declined to comment both on the details and the police department's handling of the demonstration.  However he did say that \"[t]he government of Kenya is aware Mr. Abdullah el-Faisal has been deported from several countries for alleged recruitment, inspiration and advocating of suicide bombers.  Mr. el-Faisal is a threat to this country, because of his alleged tendencies to recruit suicide bombers.\"\nMore than 300 miles away in Mombasa, Muslims held a similar demonstration on el-Faisal's behalf that ended peacefully.\nMutua reiterated the Immigration Ministry's prior statement that el-Faisal will remain imprisoned in Kenya until they are able to send him back to Jamaica, whose government already made clear that they would not receive him.\n\"This man is so dangerous,\" said Mutua. \"No country wants to touch him.\" "}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [16504, 16712, 357, 41, 1847, 828, 7229, 338, 4387, 18091, 11, 318, 2938, 284, 2393, 329, 17235, 4800, 319, 3431, 11, 6079, 281, 886, 284, 1933, 286, 13367, 546, 262, 18091, 338, 2003, 351, 645, 886, 287, 6504, 13, 198, 198, 464, 6614, 468, 587, 287, 262, 1633, 329, 517, 14813, 1115, 812, 13, 198, 198, 464, 18091, 468, 587, 5371, 625, 663, 9041, 286, 281, 4519, 287, 543, 257, 11849, 373, 2923, 319, 2805, 2242, 290, 257, 582, 3724, 287, 1644, 2223, 1708, 281, 1633, 12, 9535, 2108, 7014, 13, 198, 198, 32, 6523, 329, 262, 18091, 1297, 8428, 326, 262, 18091, 550, 645, 2912, 13, 198, 2202, 3431, 357, 16192, 2242, 828, 2869, 16712, 357, 41, 13534, 11, 1267, 373, 7530, 284, 2393, 329, 281, 6334, 2184, 1339, 706, 257, 1644, 3645, 13, 632, 318, 10061, 611, 597, 4530, 550, 587, 925, 1028, 262, 8022, 13, 1550, 3431, 11, 262, 18091, 531, 340, 550, 5717, 329, 17235, 4800], "prefix_text": "Japan Airlines (JAL), Asia's largest airline, is expected to file for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday, bringing an end to months of speculation about the airline's", "generated_result": {"0": " future with no end in sight.\n\nThe plane has been in the air for morethan three years.\n\nThe airline has been accused over its handling of an incident in which a passenger was killed on March 23 and a man died in police action following an air-traffic crash.\n\nA spokesman for the airline told Reuters that the airline had no comment.\nOn Tuesday (March 23), Japan Airlines (JLA, ) was scheduled to file for an emergency court case after a police investigation.
