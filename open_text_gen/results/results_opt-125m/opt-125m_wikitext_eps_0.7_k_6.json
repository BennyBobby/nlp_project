He handed over No. 224 Group to Air Vice Marshal Christopher Foxley @-@ Norris on 30 November. \n"}, {"ended": true, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 31114, 7, 1221, 6, 3928, 5112, 1059, 4269, 1231, 9, 5, 1754, 5721, 36, 5815, 2336, 4839, 15, 973, 644, 18202, 4, 91, 21, 3873, 10, 41452, 9, 5, 9729, 9, 2059, 11492, 8, 10, 41452, 9, 20, 9729, 9, 5, 2059, 11492, 15, 112, 644, 18069, 71, 37, 1059, 5, 78, 1231, 9, 5721, 9, 5, 2059, 1754, 1370, 4, 3928, 5112, 1665, 25, 41, 1036, 11, 258, 5, 2059, 8, 2059, 1754, 3177, 4, 50118, 50118, 49379], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Returning to Australia, Headlam became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff ( DCAS ) on 26 January 1965.

His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II, and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term, and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in March 1966 to plan the deployment. The year before, Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co @-@ operation role when it finally did deploy. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command, Melbourne, on 8 August 1966. Support Command had been formed in 1959, by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands. On 1 January 1968, Headlam was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff. He served as an Extra Gentleman Usher to the Queen from 17 November 1970 to 5 June 1971. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 256, 787, 12, 1039, 7383, 3772, 23, 10, 23043, 19, 256, 787, 12, 1039, 5962, 8, 163, 787, 12, 1039, 8971, 3072, 9, 18663, 2533, 4, 152, 23043, 16, 23, 10, 672, 9, 59, 158, 1730, 4, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 49526, 642, 15698, 50118, 41552, 48546, 50118, 41552, 642, 49007, 36407, 2496, 48893, 1270, 40635, 41552, 36407, 2496, 40635, 42060, 12, 12368, 45393, 448, 2527, 45647, 108, 46479, 448, 787, 49138, 36407, 49526, 510, 15698, 50118, 41552, 642, 2496, 47579, 42060, 12, 12368, 45393, 17312, 46215, 131, 46479, 448, 49314, 49138, 36407, 49526, 42060, 15698, 50118, 947, 282, 39596, 131, 49138, 642, 15698, 50118, 41552, 642, 2496, 5214, 947, 2253, 1242, 131, 438, 47853, 12, 36097, 947, 2253, 139, 131, 112, 6, 151, 38740, 131, 49995, 36407, 2496, 40635, 42060, 12, 5827, 36185, 10431, 506, 246, 506, 406, 242, 401, 131, 46479, 947, 282, 39596, 131, 49703, 36407, 49526, 642, 15698, 50118, 41552, 642], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> M @-@ 82 begins at a junction with M @-@ 120 and B @-@ 96 west of Fremont.

The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born Architect Louis S. Curtiss, famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper, is extant on Highland Park. The Frank Fort designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit's famed Fisher Building. Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 31408, 34, 67, 57, 3919, 25, 5, 499, 2259, 9, 5, 5750, 4455, 8, 5528, 824, 36, 8981, 3586, 32801, 20, 5750, 9082, 2033, 5, 1114, 11, 5155, 8, 11, 5241, 6, 5, 5750, 9082, 2033, 5, 695, 4, 50118, 50118, 133, 5750, 4455, 6, 5528, 8, 15309, 824, 34, 57, 10, 233, 9, 5, 331, 9, 5750, 187, 63, 17692, 11, 17616, 4, 50118, 50118, 38261, 50118, 50118, 133, 5750, 4455, 8, 11886, 1463, 36, 448, 3586, 322, 20, 256, 3586, 6, 61, 21, 1412, 25, 10, 233, 8, 20301, 9, 5, 5750, 9082, 7, 694, 1435, 7, 5444, 8, 4106, 3353, 9, 5, 1226, 8, 7, 694, 1616, 13, 521, 8, 7998, 453, 7, 5445, 49, 2038, 3168, 4, 50118, 50118, 133, 331, 1463, 15, 5, 4455, 8, 11886, 36, 3632, 250, 322, 4998, 250, 16, 10, 10507, 1651, 14, 15885, 1265, 6, 557, 6, 8, 557, 4, 50118, 448, 3586, 21, 4790, 15, 5, 18805], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( MAEC ).

The city originally had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites. A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African @-@ American library was demolished on May 28, 2008. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 343, 16, 5, 5402, 343, 11, 5, 31408, 6, 5750, 7438, 1070, 1018, 4121, 36, 211, 5273, 31311, 61, 1171, 4801, 787, 6, 1039, 8963, 8195, 19, 20928, 12545, 6, 7796, 6, 8, 97, 5175, 2110, 4, 50118, 50118, 38261, 35, 50118, 50118, 133, 31408, 21, 2885, 11, 504, 6668, 4, 20, 211, 5273, 21, 5, 78, 343, 12, 6445, 210, 443, 11, 5750, 4, 20, 210, 16, 2034, 11, 5, 31408, 6, 5750, 7438, 1070, 1018, 443, 4, 20, 210, 16, 2034, 227, 5, 5750, 1995, 8, 5750, 1995, 4, 20, 210, 16, 2034, 11, 5, 31408, 6, 4523, 12651, 50118, 50118, 133, 211, 5273, 16, 5, 1154, 210, 443, 624, 211, 5273, 8, 16, 5, 1154, 210, 443, 11, 5750, 4, 20, 210, 443, 16, 2034, 23, 5, 253, 9, 10, 251, 6, 6787, 6, 8, 6787, 921, 4, 20, 210, 443, 1171, 5, 31408, 6, 5750, 8, 5, 5750, 1995, 6599, 911, 4, 20], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions", "generated_result": {"0": ", computers, and other electronic devices.\n\nHistory:\n\nThe Meridian was established in 1881.

In light of this, the National Hurricane Center estimated Beatriz to have attained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) along with a barometric pressure of 977 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 85 inHg ) ; however, it was noted that this could be conservative based on estimates of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) from the University of Wisconsin and the Satellite Analysis Branch. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 13231, 5, 662, 9, 502, 733, 6, 10841, 21645, 23637, 5, 3673, 9, 1625, 6, 19, 5, 1312, 3133, 3667, 379, 11163, 36, 291, 6301, 4839, 2077, 787, 12, 1039, 10171, 9, 5, 343, 9, 255, 25491, 4, 50118, 50118, 9325, 24879, 329, 21, 15, 10, 2524, 31, 255, 25491, 7, 1625, 412, 6, 147, 79, 21, 1768, 7, 972, 10, 2598, 33489, 6, 54, 21, 5796, 19, 69, 6, 8, 7, 972, 10, 1441, 9, 10841, 15072, 17, 48, 29, 54, 67, 56, 10, 2524, 7, 1625, 412, 4, 50118, 50118, 9325, 24879, 329, 21, 15, 69, 169, 7, 69, 220, 6381, 4, 50118, 1121, 1625, 412, 6, 10841, 21645, 21, 1768, 7, 972, 5, 1441, 9, 277, 1441, 6, 54, 21, 5796, 552, 19, 10, 1441, 9, 10841, 15072, 17, 27, 29, 6, 54, 67, 56, 2524, 7, 1625, 412, 4, 50118, 50118, 9325, 24879, 329, 21, 15, 69, 169, 7, 69, 94, 6381, 77, 10, 313, 5508, 69, 8], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Throughout the morning of June 21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15 mi ( 20 km ) south @-@ southeast", "generated_result": {"0": " of the city of Tijuana.\n\nBeatriz was on a flight from Tijuana to Mexico City, where she was scheduled to meet a fellow traveler, who was traveling with her, and to meet a friend of Beatrix“s who also had a flight to Mexico City.\n\nBeatriz was on her way to her next destination.\nIn Mexico City, Beatriz was scheduled to meet the friend of another friend, who was traveling along with a friend of Beatrix’s, who also had flight to Mexico City.\n\nBeatriz was on her way to her last destination when a man approached her and"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> Throughout the morning of June 21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15 mi ( 20 km ) south @-@ southeast", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> Throughout the morning of June 21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15 mi ( 20 km ) south @-@ southeast of the city of Tijuana.\n\nBeatriz was on a flight from Tijuana to Mexico City, where she was scheduled to meet a fellow traveler, who was traveling with her, and to meet a friend of Beatrix“s who also had a flight to Mexico City.\n\nBeatriz was on her way to her next destination.\nIn Mexico City, Beatriz was scheduled to meet the friend of another friend, who was traveling along with a friend of Beatrix’s, who also had flight to Mexico City.\n\nBeatriz was on her way to her last destination when a man approached her and", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> Throughout the morning of June 21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15 mi ( 20 km ) south @-@ southeast of La Fortuna, Mexico.

Lead Belly was invited to perform at Camp Unity, the Communist Party USA's summer retreat, and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s. This led to the accusations that the Communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform.

It then changes to Fm – Gm @-@ Cm in the chorus, while continuing in A ♭ – Cm – A ♭ – Fm in the intermediate verses, ultimately ending in repeated lines of \" I've heard it all before \". \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 226, 4503, 3435, 5, 2214, 34, 30336, 9, 430, 11991, 217, 1515, 6, 3453, 6, 3108, 6, 5979, 6, 27428, 6, 19840, 6, 11145, 8, 2898, 4, 20, 2214, 1431, 59, 5, 301, 9, 10, 693, 11, 436, 4, 264, 1074, 11, 10, 650, 3375, 11, 5, 2791, 9, 21105, 30751, 4, 1405, 1623, 16, 10, 10305, 4, 264, 1364, 11, 10, 5566, 4, 20, 2214, 16, 10, 657, 2214, 13, 69, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15698, 226, 4503, 3435, 5, 2214, 161, 35, 22, 100, 657, 47, 6, 38, 657, 47, 6, 38, 657, 110, 657, 6, 38, 218, 75, 575, 99, 47, 206, 59, 162, 6, 53, 114, 47, 218, 17809, 90, 657, 162, 47, 17809, 890, 393, 657, 162, 456, 72, 50118, 50118, 41552, 328, 19174, 863, 1215, 495, 8625, 1215, 574, 9298, 791, 4628, 415, 35, 288, 1178, 612, 417, 401, 438, 288, 242, 306, 242, 288, 242, 288, 242, 398], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Lyrically the song has excerpts of different languages including French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Hebrew, Hindi, Polish and Japanese.

Among the various remixes, the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston's \" I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) \" with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction. Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other, from the time they wrote the song \" Heart \" ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it. The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album Disco Four. Madonna's voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook. A breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends, leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 5583, 15838, 2675, 9, 16510, 491, 875, 14, 22, 19719, 22, 16, 5, 22, 2642, 18, 8260, 1349, 22, 8, 14, 24, 16, 10, 22, 5106, 9129, 8732, 787, 12, 5827, 22, 2642, 49900, 15483, 1397, 2300, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 25883, 40635, 8166, 640, 267, 4734, 1594, 8649, 833, 2675, 4, 175, 73, 46479, 37144, 15838, 2675, 9, 5, 16510, 491, 49138, 705, 15698, 50118, 8166, 640, 1401, 4, 119, 1176, 2088, 4, 175, 73, 119, 1176, 2088, 73, 119, 1176, 1688, 73, 119, 1176, 1688, 73, 119, 1176, 241, 73, 119, 1469, 636, 73, 119, 1176, 1688, 1215, 119, 1176, 1688, 1215, 25430, 1215, 25430, 102, 1215, 119, 1176, 1688, 1215, 119, 1176, 1688, 1215, 119, 1176, 1688, 1215, 119, 1176, 1688, 1215, 119, 1176, 1688, 4, 10474, 49138, 705, 15698, 49703, 16776, 12528, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 9773, 15698, 50118, 8166, 640, 1401, 134, 4, 119, 40527, 4, 175], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest track \" and that it is a \" Pet Shop Boys @-", "generated_result": {"0": "style \" album \"<|endpointoftext|>\n<vendor=\"http://jennifervineyard.com/\">Jennifer Vineyard of the MTV News</v>\nhttp://www.majive.com/majive/majore/majore/majre/mavic/majore_majore_major_majora_majore_majore_majore_majore_majore.jpg</v> </blocktype>\n<vbody>\nhttp://www1.movies.com"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest track \" and that it is a \" Pet Shop Boys @-", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest track \" and that it is a \" Pet Shop Boys @-style \" album \"<|endpointoftext|>\n<vendor=\"http://jennifervineyard.com/\">Jennifer Vineyard of the MTV News</v>\nhttp://www.majive.com/majive/majore/majore/majre/mavic/majore_majore_major_majora_majore_majore_majore_majore_majore.jpg</v> </blocktype>\n<vbody>\nhttp://www1.movies.com", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest track \" and that it is a \" Pet Shop Boys @-@ esque \" song.

As the song progresses to the intermediate verses, Madonna engages in an energetic fight with her male dancers which demonstrated her bending her body and putting her leg over her head and jumping from the cage on a dancer's back. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 404, 20932, 7, 5, 23517, 5257, 12433, 6, 5, 22, 755, 4934, 22, 766, 12859, 7, 5, 292, 3598, 2137, 27465, 5516, 5, 314, 787, 12, 1039, 1004, 7467, 14, 9368, 1065, 5, 343, 4, 50118, 50118, 133, 22, 755, 4934, 41066, 61, 16, 5, 1609, 477, 9, 5, 343, 8, 5, 1609, 9, 5, 343, 18, 29479, 8645, 268, 6, 16, 5, 1609, 9, 5, 343, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 328, 1397, 1116, 29015, 46961, 50118, 50118, 113, 725, 29878, 274, 10002, 113, 16, 5, 1609, 477, 9, 5, 343, 6, 8, 65, 9, 5, 1609, 29479, 8645, 268, 11, 5, 232, 4, 20, 239, 477, 16, 5, 343, 18, 28038, 745, 6, 5, 22, 755, 9579, 22, 9368, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 328, 1397, 1116, 39645, 15483, 15698, 20, 22, 755, 4934, 41066, 61, 16, 5, 144, 3395, 745, 11, 5, 232, 6, 16, 67, 5, 1609, 477, 9, 5, 343, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 328, 1397], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Alluding to the celebratory gesture, the \" High Five \" name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left @-@ turn movements that tower", "generated_result": {"0": " above the city.\n\nThe \" High Five ,\" which is the highest point of the city and the highest of the city's skyscrapers, is the highest of the city.\n\n<!endoftext}}\n\n\"HIGH FIVE\" is the highest point of the city, and one of the highest skyscrapers in the world.

After two straight second @-@ place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside, Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside the second row. That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point. NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track. It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps, and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields. Two hours later, the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third. After Richmond's car was adjusted to remove the \" push \", the car was more to his liking. Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left. Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end. After Richmond took the lead with 30 laps left in the race, Dale Earnhardt made up three seconds on Richmond's five @-@ second lead. With four laps to go, Buddy Arrington spun in a three @-@ car accident. The remaining laps of the race where completed slowly under caution and Richmond took the checkered flag for the victory.

Media later reported that he had tested positive for acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ). He returned to Pocono for the Miller High Life 500 during the middle of the year.

In the middle of the race, Richmond's car suffered gearbox problems. Because he could use only fourth ( high ) gear, he had to use that gear to slowly exit the pits. Richmond was emotional after the victory, saying, \" I had tears in my eyes when I took the checkered flag.

Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 22224, 5099, 17196, 32, 4126, 787, 12, 1039, 4709, 808, 142, 51, 32, 11, 5, 4580, 1895, 9099, 9, 6485, 16296, 7, 5, 3072, 4, 520, 34257, 935, 31, 5, 3072, 16, 12315, 149, 30, 5, 3017, 6, 5, 26136, 32, 45, 441, 7, 120, 7, 5, 6485, 1186, 8, 3891, 64, 75, 120, 7, 5, 6485, 1186, 4, 50118, 50118, 713, 16, 10, 372, 1246, 9, 99, 10, 205, 1114, 24, 21, 7, 33, 10, 1895, 9099, 9, 6485, 16296, 4, 50118, 50118, 100, 206, 5, 1219, 596, 5, 26136, 32, 45, 441, 7, 120, 7, 5, 6485, 32467, 8, 4634, 5, 26136, 32, 45, 164, 7, 1338, 106, 16, 142, 5, 6485, 1186, 16, 182, 3841, 4, 50118, 2847, 5, 26136, 32, 45, 441, 7, 517, 7, 5, 6485, 4, 50118, 50118, 100, 206, 5, 1219, 14, 5, 26136, 58, 45, 441, 7, 120, 5, 32467, 21, 142, 9, 5, 3841, 1274, 4, 50118, 50118, 100], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The Trout Creek Mountains are semi @-@ arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west.

However, these areas are vital to the local ecosystem.

Narrow riparian greenways follow the year @-@ round streams. Many greenway areas have quaking aspen and willow groves. Cottonwood and alder groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is flatter and stream channels are wider. Sedges and rushes are also native to these stream bottoms. Years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species, riparian vegetation, and young aspen and willow trees. Restoration of riparian areas began in the early 1970s, and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, large wildfires in southeastern Oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range's vegetation, damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 24709, 11, 5, 22224, 5099, 17196, 32, 15517, 7, 5, 1737, 9, 5, 755, 15071, 4, 221, 47924, 4244, 32, 1537, 11, 5, 490, 6, 31235, 30241, 787, 12, 1039, 2913, 5, 1445, 17842, 8146, 6, 8, 58, 45, 450, 454, 5, 419, 3788, 29, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 83, 367, 107, 124, 6, 38, 794, 42, 618, 15, 5, 3742, 4, 38, 21, 28622, 30, 5, 527, 9, 42, 1989, 181, 4348, 36, 627, 65, 14, 3033, 11, 5, 22224, 5099, 17196, 322, 38, 33, 393, 450, 10, 4649, 11, 5, 22224, 5099, 17196, 137, 4, 38, 33, 393, 450, 10, 32003, 352, 4649, 11, 5, 22224, 5099, 17196, 137, 8, 33, 450, 5, 181, 4348, 11, 5, 3418, 4, 38, 56, 393, 450, 10, 181, 967, 324, 454, 38, 794, 42, 618, 328, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 859, 15483, 15698, 38, 33, 450, 181, 4348, 11, 5, 443, 9], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Animals in the Trout Creek Mountains are adapted to the environment of the High Desert.
