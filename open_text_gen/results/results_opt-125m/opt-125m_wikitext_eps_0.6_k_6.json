Contrary to his lazy tendencies, Shikamaru is extremely intelligent ; his teacher, Asuma Sarutobi, determined that Shikamaru's IQ was over 200. Shikamaru's abilities are based on the Shadow Imitation Technique ( 影真似の術, Kagemane no Jutsu, English TV : \" Shadow Possession Jutsu \" ), the signature technique of his clan, with which he merges his shadow with an opponent's shadow, making them immobilized and forced to mimic Shikamaru's movements.

The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events, and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 91, 7560, 30, 249, 834, 2094, 14276, 428, 8371, 187, 2338, 6, 5, 31408, 522, 641, 10726, 9, 12312, 455, 787, 12, 1039, 86, 1024, 25, 157, 25, 233, 787, 12, 111, 86, 1024, 4, 50118, 49138, 1397, 1116, 29015, 8061, 50118, 41552, 36407, 2496, 40635, 42060, 12, 12368, 35, 359, 10431, 6551, 844, 131, 448, 2527, 12, 31022, 12, 1090, 5408, 12, 31022, 12, 12778, 1594, 6, 947, 10431, 6551, 844, 25606, 42060, 5214, 9830, 131, 46479, 50118, 41552, 36407, 2496, 40635, 42060, 12, 12368, 12, 10799, 36856, 256, 2527, 12, 25450, 12, 12778, 506, 6, 31022, 113, 2496, 36856, 448, 4182, 12, 31022, 12, 12778, 1594, 6, 28716, 12, 21685, 35, 849, 506, 134, 438, 246, 506, 131, 46479, 50118, 41552, 36407, 2496, 5214, 42060, 12, 12368, 40635, 448, 2527, 12, 31022, 12, 6821, 1594, 6, 31022, 113, 2496, 36856, 17312, 12, 506, 2832, 113, 2496, 36856, 17312, 12, 13597, 113, 2496, 36856, 17312, 34133, 28716, 12], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Headed by police chief Lee Shelbourn since 2009, the Meridian Police Department consists of 115 full @-@ time officers as well as part @-", "generated_result": {"0": " - time officers.\n</endoftext >\n<span style=\"font-family: &#8220;Mso- sans-semi- sans-serif,&#8220 ;font=white;\">\n<span style=\"font-family-size:\" Mso- Sans-serf, sans\" style:\"Msp- sans-serif, font-color: #f1c3f;\">\n<span style=font-family=\"Mso- sans- serif, sans\" style:\"Mon-fond\" style:\"Mon-fin\" style:\"Mon\"- font-"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> Headed by police chief Lee Shelbourn since 2009, the Meridian Police Department consists of 115 full @-@ time officers as well as part @-", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> Headed by police chief Lee Shelbourn since 2009, the Meridian Police Department consists of 115 full @-@ time officers as well as part @- - time officers.\n</endoftext >\n<span style=\"font-family: &#8220;Mso- sans-semi- sans-serif,&#8220 ;font=white;\">\n<span style=\"font-family-size:\" Mso- Sans-serf, sans\" style:\"Msp- sans-serif, font-color: #f1c3f;\">\n<span style=font-family=\"Mso- sans- serif, sans\" style:\"Mon-fond\" style:\"Mon-fin\" style:\"Mon\"- font-", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> Headed by police chief Lee Shelbourn since 2009, the Meridian Police Department consists of 115 full @-@ time officers as well as part @-@ time and reserve staff available.

Architecture students from around the nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their coursework due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects. The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born Architect Louis S. Curtiss, famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper, is extant on Highland Park. The Frank Fort designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit's famed Fisher Building. Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 31408, 34, 67, 57, 3919, 25, 5, 499, 2259, 9, 5, 5750, 4455, 8, 5528, 824, 36, 8981, 3586, 32801, 20, 5750, 9082, 2033, 5, 1114, 11, 5155, 8, 11, 5241, 4, 31408, 34, 57, 5, 184, 9, 5, 5750, 18972, 187, 601, 6617, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 50118, 133, 5750, 4455, 8, 5528, 16, 10, 6651, 1651, 14, 1639, 5444, 8, 4000, 518, 11, 5, 5750, 1739, 149, 1265, 518, 6, 5444, 8, 4000, 1767, 6, 5984, 1767, 14, 694, 5984, 1616, 13, 70, 521, 6, 8, 5444, 8, 4000, 518, 149, 1265, 13, 70, 408, 4, 50118, 243, 4497, 11, 5, 5750, 1739, 6, 2754, 70, 9, 63, 1196, 4, 96, 1285, 89, 18, 10, 2174, 558, 8, 10, 2894, 23, 589, 9, 3053, 36, 791, 4, 250, 12345, 61, 4542, 25, 31408, 18, 4351, 9, 1265, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 328, 10975, 49741, 12, 10273], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( MAEC ).

The city originally had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites. A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African @-@ American library was demolished on May 28, 2008. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 343, 16, 5, 5402, 343, 11, 5, 31408, 6, 5750, 7438, 1070, 1018, 4121, 36, 211, 5273, 31311, 61, 1171, 4801, 787, 6, 1039, 8963, 8195, 19, 20928, 12545, 6, 7796, 6, 8, 97, 5175, 2110, 49069, 15483, 15698, 28696, 3809, 49007, 36407, 15698, 133, 343, 16, 1440, 71, 5, 78, 3647, 9, 31408, 4, 20, 343, 16, 1440, 71, 5, 78, 3647, 54, 21, 1440, 71, 31408, 4, 20, 343, 16, 373, 71, 5, 78, 3647, 9, 31408, 4, 20, 343, 34, 1440, 71, 5, 78, 3647, 9, 31408, 4, 20, 343, 16, 684, 25, 31408, 49069, 3809, 2496, 40635, 48921, 12, 6960, 35, 321, 38740, 131, 49995, 3809, 49007, 102, 48225, 40635, 8166, 640, 1401, 134, 4, 627, 12984, 493, 4, 876, 4, 1350, 73, 8331, 73, 14420, 73, 12488, 73, 1549, 73, 2089, 32707, 12, 14853, 12, 26442, 73, 46479, 46982, 2600, 42484, 49703, 102, 49526, 8355, 49526, 428, 15698, 28696, 3809, 49007, 3809], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions", "generated_result": {"0": ", computers, and other electronic devices.<|> <br><span>The city is named after the first mayor of Meridian.

There are numerous large boulders deposited by Pleistocene glaciation. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 23106, 312, 2126, 16, 5, 2087, 9, 10, 316, 2831, 37048, 1982, 11, 3470, 41498, 6, 61, 16, 5, 7763, 14692, 3780, 31, 264, 90, 1245, 4, 85, 2656, 19, 10, 313, 18, 2120, 7, 1871, 39, 1354, 31, 10, 27936, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 642, 15698, 133, 1270, 22, 510, 23106, 5320, 368, 1297, 61, 839, 22, 642, 658, 718, 1297, 839, 7, 22, 31575, 1297, 11, 2370, 4, 85, 34, 41, 2370, 19850, 9, 5, 5862, 2136, 6, 13102, 102, 4, 20, 13102, 1526, 620, 368, 16, 16934, 7, 1266, 7, 1871, 6, 11, 2370, 31, 13102, 1526, 620, 368, 36, 642, 658, 687, 238, 61, 16, 5, 5862, 13, 22, 560, 492, 113, 50, 22, 560, 492, 845, 20, 5862, 13102, 1526, 620, 368, 36, 642, 658, 687, 43, 16, 5, 766, 9, 5, 1040, 11, 61, 5, 37048, 21, 1982, 4, 20, 37048, 21, 1982, 11, 5, 76, 316, 2831, 4, 85, 16, 45, 684], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Papa Stour is the subject of a 1299 manuscript written in Old Norse, which is the oldest surviving document from Shetland.

The Papa Stour Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues. Ferries now sail across the Sound of Papa to West Burrafirth on the Shetland Mainland. The crossing takes 45 minutes, and although the Snolda carries cars, there is only one short road on the island.For visiting yachts the four main voes provide good shelter, but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 22, 9224, 179, 274, 5156, 102, 109, 261, 328, 22, 12859, 7, 5, 28504, 30955, 108, 32524, 9, 4533, 5577, 49, 490, 5651, 4293, 66, 7, 3342, 454, 5, 239, 35952, 32, 2913, 19, 5, 3342, 8, 51, 64, 2916, 3539, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 15698, 20, 28504, 35363, 32, 45, 1220, 7, 6966, 11, 5, 6444, 4, 50118, 50118, 713, 16, 10, 182, 1406, 5651, 9205, 14, 21, 19442, 8, 16, 341, 30, 171, 16516, 11, 5, 375, 4, 50118, 243, 16, 67, 65, 5, 144, 1406, 5651, 7373, 11, 1005, 25, 157, 328, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 15698, 20, 16516, 32, 67, 1220, 7, 185, 49, 8934, 66, 15, 5, 3342, 6, 8, 51, 64, 120, 2037, 11, 5, 3342, 4, 50118, 50118, 133, 16516, 32, 460, 553, 7, 185, 49, 8934, 66, 7, 5, 514, 6, 8, 51, 2333, 109, 98, 4, 50118, 133, 16516, 109, 45, 460, 33, 5, 86, 6, 8], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> \" Rowin Foula doon! \" refers to the fishermens'practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs", "generated_result": {"0": " are covered with the sea and they can catch fish.\n\n<|> The fisherfolk are not allowed to swim in the ocean.\n\nThis is a very popular fishing technique that was invented and is used by many fishermen in the past.\nIt is also one the most popular fishing techniques in Europe as well!\n\n<|> The fishermen are also allowed to take their boats out on the sea, and they can get caught in the sea.\n\nThe fishermen are always asked to take their boats out to the water, and they usually do so.\nThe fishermen do not always have the time, and"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> \" Rowin Foula doon! \" refers to the fishermens'practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> \" Rowin Foula doon! \" refers to the fishermens'practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs are covered with the sea and they can catch fish.\n\n<|> The fisherfolk are not allowed to swim in the ocean.\n\nThis is a very popular fishing technique that was invented and is used by many fishermen in the past.\nIt is also one the most popular fishing techniques in Europe as well!\n\n<|> The fishermen are also allowed to take their boats out on the sea, and they can get caught in the sea.\n\nThe fishermen are always asked to take their boats out to the water, and they usually do so.\nThe fishermen do not always have the time, and", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> \" Rowin Foula doon! \" refers to the fishermens'practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of Foula were no longer visible.

Lead Belly was invited to perform at Camp Unity, the Communist Party USA's summer retreat, and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s.

Also built into the construction contract was a provision that Zachry was charged for \" lane rentals \" by TxDOT for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on hourly assessments and the time of day the lane was closed.

Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left. Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end.

With four laps to go, Buddy Arrington spun in a three @-@ car accident. The remaining laps of the race where completed slowly under caution and Richmond took the checkered flag for the victory.

However, large wildfires in southeastern Oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range's vegetation, damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 24709, 11, 5, 22224, 5099, 17196, 32, 15517, 7, 5, 1737, 9, 5, 755, 15071, 4, 221, 47924, 4244, 32, 1537, 11, 5, 490, 6, 31235, 30241, 787, 12, 1039, 2913, 30, 10, 739, 6, 7992, 6, 7992, 6, 8, 19790, 34365, 4, 20, 6964, 293, 32, 7992, 8, 19790, 8, 32, 2913, 30, 10, 19790, 6, 7992, 34365, 4, 252, 32, 67, 2913, 30, 19790, 6, 7992, 22178, 4, 20, 6964, 293, 32, 2913, 30, 19790, 7992, 22178, 8, 32, 2913, 30, 7992, 6, 7992, 3980, 4, 20, 6964, 293, 32, 2913, 30, 19790, 22178, 9, 10, 739, 1836, 4, 252, 32, 19790, 22178, 9, 5, 1836, 9, 10, 650, 3477, 4, 221, 47924, 29242, 32, 1537, 11, 5, 490, 6964, 293, 8, 19790, 19790, 14275, 4, 2667, 1186, 16, 4007, 8, 14903, 4, 252, 680, 5, 239, 10348, 6, 5, 10348, 35512, 8, 5, 38905, 9, 5, 10348, 4, 252, 32, 5, 1154, 9, 5, 4707, 8], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Animals in the Trout Creek Mountains are adapted to the environment of the High Desert.
