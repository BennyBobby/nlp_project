Divorced from his first wife in 1956, he married widowed social worker Vernon Spence at the Sydney registry office on 20 January 1964. He handed over No. 224 Group to Air Vice Marshal Christopher Foxley @-@ Norris on 30 November. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 31114, 7, 1221, 6, 3928, 5112, 1059, 4269, 1231, 9, 5, 1754, 5721, 36, 5815, 2336, 4839, 15, 973, 644, 18202, 4, 91, 21, 3873, 10, 41452, 9, 5, 9729, 9, 1221, 15, 112, 644, 18069, 4, 91, 21, 7715, 7, 4269, 1231, 9, 5, 1754, 5721, 23, 5, 253, 9, 5, 1771, 23, 5, 253, 772, 16344, 4, 50118, 49085, 1397, 1397, 1116, 29015, 1721, 15698, 31114, 15, 501, 550, 14873, 7, 1221, 6, 1292, 3928, 5112, 1059, 4269, 1231, 9, 5, 2938, 5721, 4, 91, 21, 3873, 10, 41452, 7, 5, 2059, 9729, 9, 1221, 30, 3929, 4690, 3082, 15, 112, 644, 15386, 4, 50118, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 1721, 15698, 11968, 7, 1221, 6, 1292, 3928, 5112, 3374, 1231, 23901, 9, 5, 2059, 2938, 11, 5, 1771, 23, 20, 24852, 15, 112, 644, 15386, 4, 50118, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 1721, 50118, 15698, 50118, 7605, 5, 253, 9, 5, 1771, 11, 5, 419, 5114, 29], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Returning to Australia, Headlam became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff ( DCAS ) on 26 January 1965.

His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II, and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term, and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in March 1966 to plan the deployment. The year before, Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co @-@ operation role when it finally did deploy. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command, Melbourne, on 8 August 1966. Support Command had been formed in 1959, by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands. On 1 January 1968, Headlam was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff.

The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 31408, 34, 67, 57, 3919, 25, 5, 499, 2259, 9, 5, 5750, 4455, 8, 5528, 824, 36, 8981, 3586, 32801, 20, 5750, 9082, 2033, 5, 1114, 11, 5155, 8, 11, 5241, 24, 21, 2033, 30, 5, 5750, 1112, 4, 50118, 50118, 133, 5750, 4455, 8, 5528, 824, 36, 8981, 3586, 43, 34, 57, 3919, 7, 28, 5, 499, 2259, 9, 5, 4630, 4455, 8, 5528, 824, 8, 5, 5750, 331, 589, 36, 6222, 6972, 322, 20, 5750, 9082, 2763, 7, 5242, 5, 8981, 3586, 11, 4482, 4, 50118, 50118, 133, 5750, 1112, 2033, 5, 7147, 9, 5, 8981, 3586, 94, 76, 25, 10, 898, 9, 5, 194, 446, 18, 2846, 9, 5, 194, 18, 78, 12, 6294, 1229, 4, 20, 1112, 12008, 2033, 5, 7147, 9, 5, 8981, 3586, 11, 494, 4482, 19, 5, 323, 9, 258, 5, 446, 9, 7395, 8, 1112, 4, 50118, 50118, 1620, 9, 494, 4482, 6, 256, 13709, 34, 10, 746, 9, 68], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( MAEC ).

A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African @-@ American library was demolished on May 28, 2008. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 343, 16, 5, 5402, 343, 11, 5, 31408, 6, 5750, 7438, 1070, 1018, 4121, 36, 211, 5273, 31311, 61, 1171, 4801, 787, 6, 1039, 8963, 8195, 19, 20928, 12545, 6, 7796, 6, 8, 3551, 4247, 4, 20, 211, 5273, 16, 5, 1154, 343, 11, 5, 31408, 6, 5750, 7438, 1070, 1018, 4121, 36, 211, 5273, 31311, 61, 1171, 4801, 4, 134, 207, 9, 63, 746, 443, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 343, 16, 5, 5402, 343, 6, 11, 10, 739, 233, 142, 9, 99, 24, 16, 684, 25, 5, 31408, 6, 5750, 7438, 1070, 1018, 4121, 36, 211, 5273, 47162, 5, 343, 16, 5, 1154, 6, 11, 10, 739, 233, 142, 9, 5, 31408, 6, 5750, 7438, 1070, 27878, 4121, 36, 18695, 3813, 31311, 61, 1171, 4801, 4, 134, 207, 9, 63, 746, 443, 4, 96, 5, 211, 5273, 6, 5, 1196, 9, 31408, 6, 5750, 32, 5, 1154, 11], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions", "generated_result": {"0": ", computers, and cell phones.

Three hours after classification, the depression strengthened Tropical Storm Beatriz, the second named storm of the season. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 8451, 15, 502, 291, 6, 26991, 14970, 1130, 32581, 19, 484, 81, 1193, 23894, 13657, 36, 3069, 11367, 30, 3613, 787, 12, 1039, 299, 3971, 874, 42736, 1812, 33397, 230, 36, 4839, 8, 42736, 1812, 36, 31311, 8, 19, 10, 367, 81, 1193, 23894, 13657, 36, 31311, 8, 11, 5, 1390, 6, 26991, 14970, 1130, 3625, 19, 10, 367, 81, 1193, 23894, 13657, 8, 10, 367, 26991, 14970, 81, 1193, 23894, 13657, 36, 31311, 5203, 11, 484, 81, 298, 22736, 13657, 36, 31311, 217, 10, 367, 81, 1193, 23894, 81, 32705, 36, 31311, 8, 10, 182, 739, 81, 1193, 23894, 81, 32705, 36, 31311, 5203, 11, 10, 182, 739, 81, 298, 22736, 81, 10393, 154, 36, 31311, 5203, 11, 10, 182, 670, 26991, 14970, 26991, 32526, 36, 31311, 10, 670, 26991, 14970, 26991, 32526, 36, 31311, 8, 10, 182, 670, 670, 26991, 14970, 26991, 32526, 47529, 479, 2546, 207, 9, 26991, 14970, 43, 36], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Early on June 20, convection increased markedly with several overshooting tops ( denoted by cloud @-@ top temperatures below − 80 ° C (", "generated_result": {"0": " ) and − 80 ( ), and with a few overshooting tops ( ), and in the afternoon, convection increased significantly with a few overshooting tops and a few convection overshooting tops ( ), resulting in several overhazing tops ( ), including a few overshooting overshots ( ), and a very large overshooting overshots ( ), resulting in a very large overhazing overshoting ( ), resulting in a very strong convection convecture ( ), a strong convection convecture ( ), and a very strong strong convection convecture (> .05% of convection) ("}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> Early on June 20, convection increased markedly with several overshooting tops ( denoted by cloud @-@ top temperatures below − 80 ° C (", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> Early on June 20, convection increased markedly with several overshooting tops ( denoted by cloud @-@ top temperatures below − 80 ° C ( ) and − 80 ( ), and with a few overshooting tops ( ), and in the afternoon, convection increased significantly with a few overshooting tops and a few convection overshooting tops ( ), resulting in several overhazing tops ( ), including a few overshooting overshots ( ), and a very large overshooting overshots ( ), resulting in a very large overhazing overshoting ( ), resulting in a very strong convection convecture ( ), a strong convection convecture ( ), and a very strong strong convection convecture (> .05% of convection) (", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> Early on June 20, convection increased markedly with several overshooting tops ( denoted by cloud @-@ top temperatures below − 80 ° C ( − 112 ° F ) ) appearing on satellite imagery.

She promoted the album at the dance party \" Misshapes \" held at Luke & Leroy's nightclub in Greenwich Village, invited by Junior Sanchez to take over the DJ booth where she mixed \" Hung Up \" with \" Sorry \". Musically, \" Sorry \" is an uptempo dance song containing layers of beats and strong vocal on the chorus. It is set in common time with a moderately fast dance groove tempo of 132 beats per minute. Composed in the key of C minor, Madonna's vocal range spans from F3 to G4. It follows the chord progression of E ♭ – Cm – A ♭ – B ♭ during the spoken introduction. It then changes to Fm – Gm @-@ Cm in the chorus, while continuing in A ♭ – Cm – A ♭ – Fm in the intermediate verses, ultimately ending in repeated lines of \" I've heard it all before \". \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 226, 4503, 3435, 5, 2214, 34, 30336, 9, 430, 11991, 217, 1515, 6, 3453, 6, 3108, 6, 5979, 6, 27428, 6, 19840, 6, 11145, 8, 2898, 4, 20, 2214, 1431, 59, 5, 3585, 9, 5, 1515, 25, 10, 2777, 11, 5, 2297, 232, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 36407, 2496, 40635, 42060, 10799, 35, 739, 4, 42060, 12, 12368, 35, 359, 2253, 5992, 131, 104, 1253, 12, 12778, 1594, 947, 2253, 1242, 48640, 947, 2253, 5992, 131, 31022, 12, 4182, 11937, 879, 131, 49853, 36407, 15698, 50118, 50118, 41552, 36407, 1380, 40635, 42060, 12, 10799, 35, 739, 4, 42060, 12, 12368, 35, 947, 3914, 131, 2253, 1242, 48803, 50118, 10431, 49741, 50118, 50118, 10431, 49741, 50118, 50118, 41552, 36407, 2496, 49991, 506, 1755, 46479, 50118, 50118, 41552, 36407, 2496, 47579, 42060, 12, 10799, 35, 739, 4, 42060, 3358, 21685, 35, 849, 506, 1755, 131, 108, 49007, 36407, 1907, 40635, 29015, 46479, 50118, 50118, 113, 1185, 216, 6, 38, 437], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Lyrically the song has excerpts of different languages including French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Hebrew, Hindi, Polish and Japanese.

Among the various remixes, the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston's \" I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) \" with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction. Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other, from the time they wrote the song \" Heart \" ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it. The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album Disco Four. Madonna's voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook. A breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends, leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends. \n"}, {"ended": true, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 5583, 15838, 2675, 9, 16510, 491, 875, 14, 22, 19719, 22, 16, 5, 22, 2642, 18, 8260, 1349, 22, 8, 14, 24, 16, 10, 22, 5106, 9129, 8732, 787, 45390, 2642, 4, 50118, 49138, 705, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 15698, 50118, 947, 7984, 131, 705, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 15698], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest track \" and that it is a \" Pet Shop Boys @-", "generated_result": {"0": "\" album.\n</v>\n<v>\n<v>\n<v>\n<v>\n&lt;v>\n<v>"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest track \" and that it is a \" Pet Shop Boys @-", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest track \" and that it is a \" Pet Shop Boys @-\" album.\n</v>\n<v>\n<v>\n<v>\n<v>\n&lt;v>\n<v>", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest track \" and that it is a \" Pet Shop Boys @-@ esque \" song.

For example, it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete's strength ( the first time TxDOT had ever done so ), and contained an early completion bonus, a sliding scale of up to $ 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years. Also built into the construction contract was a provision that Zachry was charged for \" lane rentals \" by TxDOT for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on hourly assessments and the time of day the lane was closed. The fees ranged from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @,@ 000 for rush hours. In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction, the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and viaducts so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed.

Richmond raced in three more events that season. \n"}, {"ended": true, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 572, 14401, 148, 5, 78, 183, 9, 7310, 13, 5, 5114, 7902, 1764, 6, 7851, 21507, 4756, 5, 753, 212, 1158, 737, 11, 5, 1015, 4, 91, 1006, 39, 169, 62, 7, 5, 299, 9, 5, 882, 6, 602, 5, 483, 31, 39, 8351, 6, 988, 1811, 783, 8365, 6, 54, 21, 11, 5, 1692, 9, 200, 317, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 15698, 20, 1015, 21, 351, 15, 8040, 112, 6, 147, 7851, 21, 5, 129, 11578, 7, 1015, 11, 5, 299, 158, 4, 91, 1550, 11, 5, 299, 158, 6, 53, 129, 71, 1811, 783, 8365, 6050, 4, 50118, 1121, 5, 200, 1015, 6, 7851, 362, 5, 483, 31, 10, 8351, 6, 150, 1811, 783, 8365, 362, 200, 317, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 15698, 20, 1015, 21, 351, 456, 15, 8516, 921, 6, 147, 1811, 783, 8365, 6050, 4], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> After crashing during the first day of qualifying for the 1980 Indianapolis 500, Richmond nevertheless obtained the 19th starting position in the race.

NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track.

Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 22224, 5099, 17196, 32, 4126, 787, 12, 1039, 4709, 808, 142, 51, 32, 11, 5, 4580, 1895, 9099, 9, 6485, 16296, 7, 5, 3072, 4, 520, 34257, 935, 31, 5, 3072, 606, 31, 5, 3017, 6, 24, 16, 45, 25, 3841, 4, 20, 1895, 9099, 16, 10, 182, 3841, 9099, 4, 20, 1895, 9099, 16, 10, 182, 251, 9099, 14, 16, 129, 10, 367, 1730, 251, 4, 20, 7727, 935, 31, 5, 3017, 16, 45, 25, 3841, 25, 24, 16, 31, 5, 3072, 4, 20, 3017, 8, 3072, 9, 5, 6485, 16296, 32, 182, 3841, 6, 8, 3891, 5, 1895, 9099, 16, 45, 25, 3841, 25, 24, 16, 11, 5, 1926, 4, 520, 5, 1895, 9099, 16, 45, 25, 3841, 25, 24, 16, 11, 5, 1926, 6, 5, 1895, 9099, 16, 45, 25, 3841, 25, 24, 16, 11, 5, 2077, 4, 20, 1895, 9099, 16, 10, 182, 251, 9099, 6, 8, 3891, 5, 1895, 9099, 16, 45, 25], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The Trout Creek Mountains are semi @-@ arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west.

Narrow riparian greenways follow the year @-@ round streams. Many greenway areas have quaking aspen and willow groves. Cottonwood and alder groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is flatter and stream channels are wider. Sedges and rushes are also native to these stream bottoms. Years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species, riparian vegetation, and young aspen and willow trees. Restoration of riparian areas began in the early 1970s, and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, large wildfires in southeastern Oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range's vegetation, damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 24709, 11, 5, 22224, 5099, 17196, 32, 15517, 7, 5, 1737, 9, 5, 755, 15071, 4, 221, 47924, 4244, 32, 1537, 11, 5, 490, 6, 31235, 30241, 787, 12, 1039, 2913, 30, 5, 6964, 28696, 15483, 15698, 28696, 15483, 15698, 28696, 15483, 15698, 28696, 15483, 15698, 28696, 15483, 15698, 28696, 15483, 15698, 28696, 15483, 15698, 28696, 15483, 15698, 28696, 328, 41552, 328, 41552, 328, 48203, 48203, 41552, 288, 15698, 50118, 50118, 133, 22224, 5099, 17196, 6, 10, 233, 9, 5, 755, 1384, 9, 5, 315, 532, 6, 32, 5, 144, 505, 8, 505, 9, 239, 10348, 24843, 9, 5, 232, 36, 387, 4, 344, 21205, 6, 44, 48, 133, 1211, 1845, 17196, 6, 886, 6, 17, 9253, 6, 33906, 4, 231, 12, 406, 322, 20, 22224, 5099, 17196, 32, 5, 144, 505, 8, 505, 9, 239, 6485, 24843, 9, 5, 232, 4, 20, 26136, 23954, 16, 5, 144, 505, 8, 4096, 9, 239, 10348, 24843, 9, 5], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Animals in the Trout Creek Mountains are adapted to the environment of the High Desert.
