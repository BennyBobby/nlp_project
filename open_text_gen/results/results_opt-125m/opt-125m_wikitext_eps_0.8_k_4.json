Four of No. 2 Squadron's Hudsons were destroyed in the attack ; the remainder were relocated to Daly Waters, where they continued to carry out reconnaissance and bombing missions against Japanese targets in Timor. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 3928, 5112, 2442, 11, 24458, 25, 33737, 9, 10919, 23, 23723, 369, 787, 12, 1039, 2027, 4121, 9539, 454, 316, 392, 27784, 6, 77, 37, 21, 1278, 7, 234, 9583, 6, 147, 37, 21, 7715, 7, 33737, 9, 5, 10919, 4, 91, 21, 7715, 7, 33737, 1292, 9, 10919, 23, 23723, 369, 23, 158, 35, 612, 15, 316, 212, 392, 27939, 8, 21, 7715, 15, 112, 620, 502, 27784, 7, 9539, 33737, 1292, 9, 10919, 23, 23723, 369, 23, 361, 35, 612, 15, 316, 212, 502, 27784, 4, 91, 21, 7715, 7, 33737, 1292, 9, 23701, 5033, 10919, 23, 23723, 369, 23, 316, 35, 612, 15, 508, 212, 502, 27784, 4, 91, 16, 8203, 23, 5, 496, 12472, 9, 1221, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 3928, 5112, 2442, 25, 33737, 13, 10919, 13, 23723, 369, 23, 158, 35, 612, 15, 316, 212, 392, 27784, 6, 147, 37, 1665, 454, 316, 392, 27939, 6, 77], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Headlam remained in Darwin as Controller of Operations at Headquarters North @-@ Western Area Command until 12 May 1942, when he was posted to Nhill,", "generated_result": {"0": " where he was promoted to Controller of the Operations.

Support Command had been formed in 1959, by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands. On 1 January 1968, Headlam was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff. He served as an Extra Gentleman Usher to the Queen from 17 November 1970 to 5 June 1971. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 256, 787, 12, 1039, 7383, 3772, 23, 10, 23043, 19, 256, 787, 12, 1039, 5962, 8, 163, 787, 12, 1039, 8971, 3072, 9, 18663, 2533, 4, 152, 23043, 16, 23, 10, 23043, 19, 256, 787, 12, 1039, 5962, 8, 256, 787, 12, 1039, 8940, 3072, 9, 18663, 2533, 4, 152, 23043, 16, 23, 10, 23043, 19, 256, 787, 12, 1039, 5962, 8, 256, 787, 12, 1039, 8971, 3072, 9, 18663, 2533, 4, 20, 23043, 16, 23, 10, 23043, 19, 256, 787, 12, 10431, 8971, 3072, 9, 18663, 2533, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 256, 787, 12, 1039, 7383, 3772, 23, 10, 23043, 19, 256, 849, 12, 1039, 7383, 8, 163, 163, 163, 230, 230, 230, 230, 230, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 49526, 36407, 15698, 50118, 15698, 50118, 15698, 50118, 41552, 328, 12, 50118, 49007, 36407, 2496, 40635, 42060, 12, 12368, 35, 6851, 18068, 2426, 6, 6851, 18068, 2426, 6, 31022, 12], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> M @-@ 82 begins at a junction with M @-@ 120 and B @-@ 96 west of Fremont.

The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events, and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 91, 7560, 30, 249, 834, 2094, 14276, 428, 8371, 187, 2338, 6, 5, 31408, 522, 641, 10726, 9, 12312, 455, 787, 12, 1039, 86, 1024, 25, 157, 25, 233, 787, 12, 1039, 86, 1024, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 18547, 1116, 29015, 1721, 15698, 20, 31408, 249, 1494, 16, 10, 233, 9, 5, 5750, 331, 522, 4, 20, 1494, 16, 10, 233, 9, 5, 5750, 3954, 7795, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 4680, 1116, 29015, 1721, 15698, 20, 31408, 522, 641, 16, 10, 249, 1494, 11, 5750, 4, 20, 1494, 16, 41, 10515, 9, 5, 5750, 331, 522, 4, 50118, 41552, 15483, 4680, 1116, 29015, 1721, 49007, 15483, 18547, 1116, 29015, 1721, 15698, 20, 31408, 522, 641, 21, 2885, 11, 504, 6405, 4, 50118, 41552, 15483, 4680, 1116, 29015, 1721, 49526, 642, 15698, 50118, 41552, 15483, 18547, 1116, 29015, 49526, 642, 49007, 642, 15698, 50118, 41552, 642, 15698, 50118, 41552, 642, 15698, 50118, 41552, 642, 15698, 50118, 41552, 642], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Headed by police chief Lee Shelbourn since 2009, the Meridian Police Department consists of 115 full @-@ time officers as well as part @-", "generated_result": {"0": "@ time officers.\n\n<|Endoftext |> The Meridian police department is a part of the Mississippi State Police.

Architecture students from around the nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their coursework due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects. The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born Architect Louis S. Curtiss, famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper, is extant on Highland Park. The Frank Fort designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit's famed Fisher Building. Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 31408, 34, 67, 57, 3919, 25, 5, 499, 2259, 9, 5, 5750, 4455, 8, 5528, 824, 36, 8981, 3586, 32801, 20, 5750, 9082, 2033, 5, 1114, 11, 5155, 8, 11, 5241, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 5750, 4455, 8, 5528, 824, 36, 8981, 3586, 4839, 16, 10, 3575, 5444, 8, 4000, 1312, 14, 21, 1490, 11, 504, 6468, 4, 85, 21, 5, 1082, 13, 5, 194, 18, 78, 285, 1808, 5707, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 253, 1116, 29015, 15483, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 5750, 4455, 8, 5528, 824, 36, 6253, 3586, 4839, 16, 10, 3575, 5444, 8, 4000, 1312, 14, 21, 1490, 11, 504, 6468, 4, 85, 21, 3249, 10, 194, 12, 4447, 745, 6, 53, 21, 423, 8417, 88, 10, 194, 12, 4447, 745, 4, 20, 6253, 3376, 21, 5, 1082, 8, 5, 1082, 9, 5, 78, 285, 1808, 5707, 11, 730, 4, 50140], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( MAEC ).

The city originally had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites. A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African @-@ American library was demolished on May 28, 2008. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 343, 16, 5, 5402, 343, 11, 5, 31408, 6, 5750, 7438, 1070, 1018, 4121, 36, 211, 5273, 31311, 61, 1171, 4801, 787, 6, 1039, 8963, 8195, 19, 20928, 12545, 6, 10, 5560, 6, 10, 6545, 22118, 4031, 6, 10, 6545, 8, 10, 16246, 19036, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 343, 16, 5, 5402, 343, 11, 5, 31408, 6, 4630, 7438, 1258, 1018, 4121, 9, 5, 5750, 7438, 1070, 1018, 36, 256, 12550, 31311, 61, 1171, 4801, 787, 6, 1039, 1814, 8195, 19, 2384, 6, 10, 5704, 1312, 6, 10, 16246, 19036, 6, 10, 5704, 2100, 6, 10, 16246, 19036, 6545, 22118, 4031, 8, 10, 6545, 19036, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 1721, 15698, 20, 343, 16, 5, 5402, 343, 11, 5, 31408, 6, 4630, 7438, 1258, 1018, 4121, 6, 61, 1171, 4801, 787, 6, 1039, 8963, 8195, 19, 20928, 12545, 6, 10, 5560, 6, 10, 6545, 22118, 4031], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions", "generated_result": {"0": ", a library, a gymnasium, a gym and a gymnasia.\n\n<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Missouri Designation Market Area of the Mississippi Designated Market ( MMD ), which includes 72 @,@ 90 households with television, a fitness center, a gymnasia, a fitness centre, a gymnasia gymnasium and a gymasia.\n\n< |> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Missouri Designation Market Area, which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions, a library, a gymnasium"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions, a library, a gymnasium, a gym and a gymnasia.\n\n<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Missouri Designation Market Area of the Mississippi Designated Market ( MMD ), which includes 72 @,@ 90 households with television, a fitness center, a gymnasia, a fitness centre, a gymnasia gymnasium and a gymasia.\n\n< |> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Missouri Designation Market Area, which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions, a library, a gymnasium", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions.

Portions of Colima, Chiapas, Michoacán and Jalisco experienced heavy rains ; however, in many areas, the rain proved beneficial in mitigating a severe drought. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 1993, 930, 26893, 1248, 5, 2410, 9, 22, 20, 163, 44841, 7239, 22, 7, 14243, 163, 10917, 18, 502, 31556, 1805, 7, 663, 6, 5815, 6, 77, 37, 21, 4036, 7, 5, 735, 3138, 7, 2268, 5, 22, 133, 7239, 113, 19, 270, 6099, 17800, 4, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 705, 134, 49085, 50118, 41552, 705, 176, 49085, 50118, 41552, 705, 246, 49085, 50118, 41552, 705, 306, 49085, 41552, 43336, 245, 49085, 50118, 41552, 705, 401, 49085, 15483, 50118, 41552, 705, 398, 49085, 50118, 41552, 705, 466, 15483, 41552, 705, 698, 49085, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 705, 466, 49085, 50118, 49138, 705, 134, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 134, 49085, 50118, 49138, 705, 176, 49526, 705, 246, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 134, 49085, 41552, 705, 176, 49085, 50118, 49138, 705, 134, 15698, 28696, 705, 134, 49085, 41552], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Most music historians date the writing of \" The Bourgeois Blues \" to Lead Belly's June 1937 trip to Washington, DC, when he was invited", "generated_result": {"0": " to the Whitehouse to discuss the \"The Blues\" with President Franklin Roosevelt.\n<|\n<|\n<|\n<v1||\n<v2||\n<v3||\n<v4||<vv5||\n<v6|||\n<v8||\n<v9|<v10||\n<|\n<v9||\n</v1>\n<v1||\n</v2></v3>\n<v1||<v2||\n</v1> <v1||<"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> Most music historians date the writing of \" The Bourgeois Blues \" to Lead Belly's June 1937 trip to Washington, DC, when he was invited", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> Most music historians date the writing of \" The Bourgeois Blues \" to Lead Belly's June 1937 trip to Washington, DC, when he was invited to the Whitehouse to discuss the \"The Blues\" with President Franklin Roosevelt.\n<|\n<|\n<|\n<v1||\n<v2||\n<v3||\n<v4||<vv5||\n<v6|||\n<v8||\n<v9|<v10||\n<|\n<v9||\n</v1>\n<v1||\n</v2></v3>\n<v1||<v2||\n</v1> <v1||<", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> Most music historians date the writing of \" The Bourgeois Blues \" to Lead Belly's June 1937 trip to Washington, DC, when he was invited by the folklorist Alan Lomax to record for the Library of Congress's folk music collection.

There is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics. After its release, it became popular with left @-@ wing political groups. Lead Belly was invited to perform at Camp Unity, the Communist Party USA's summer retreat, and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s. This led to the accusations that the Communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform. The party claims, to the contrary, that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 22, 19719, 22, 21, 65, 9, 5, 78, 5297, 2226, 13, 10303, 27366, 15, 10, 11101, 21607, 6, 552, 19, 22, 29604, 3105, 22, 8, 22, 7543, 5463, 3697, 43809, 50118, 50118, 41552, 642, 15698, 100, 437, 45, 686, 114, 47, 348, 450, 5, 569, 6, 53, 38, 437, 164, 7, 860, 7, 146, 24, 10, 410, 55, 2679, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 642, 15698, 713, 16, 10, 569, 14, 38, 156, 13, 10303, 27366, 15, 10, 11101, 21607, 4, 85, 18, 10, 3344, 9, 10, 891, 9, 5297, 31, 5, 128, 3248, 29, 6, 8, 38, 437, 164, 7, 860, 7, 146, 24, 10, 410, 55, 7580, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 642, 49721, 19719, 22, 21, 65, 9, 5, 78, 5297, 2226, 13, 10303, 27366, 15, 10, 11101, 21607, 6, 552, 19, 22, 7543, 5463, 3697, 43809, 50118, 50118, 41552, 642, 49721, 29604, 3105, 22, 21, 65, 9, 5, 78, 5297, 703, 13, 5, 10303, 27366, 15], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> \" Sorry \" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with \" Hung Up \" and \" Future Lovers \".", "generated_result": {"0": "\n\n<p>I'm not sure if you've seen the video, but I'm going to try to make it a little more interesting.\n\n<p>This is a video that I made for Confessions on a Dance Floor.

Among the various remixes, the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston's \" I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) \" with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction. Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other, from the time they wrote the song \" Heart \" ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it.

Returning to Pocono, he finished second, before winning his first race on the road course at Riverside, California the following week. Later that season, he earned his first pole position at Bristol. The tour returned to Riverside for the final race of the season where Richmond won his second race, sweeping both events at the track. Benny Parsons said that \" watching Richmond go through the Esses was unbelievable \". For the season, Richmond had twelve top 10s, two wins, and one pole to finish 26th in points. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 7851, 1770, 16544, 7100, 8484, 8303, 11, 11265, 6, 147, 37, 11981, 62, 19, 3142, 3419, 834, 3268, 17229, 4, 85, 362, 5, 165, 454, 5, 1692, 9, 5, 191, 7, 120, 5, 512, 7, 5, 477, 147, 51, 58, 441, 7, 339, 5, 2836, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 705, 25883, 15483, 41552, 705, 6423, 5214, 8166, 640, 119, 33523, 43407, 4, 175, 73, 33119, 12, 463, 12, 28023, 73, 119, 33523, 43407, 73, 119, 33523, 43407, 12, 119, 33523, 43407, 12, 119, 33523, 43407, 12, 119, 33523, 43407, 12, 119, 33523, 43407, 50118, 50118, 41552, 642, 15698, 133, 165, 34, 57, 11, 5, 10591, 13780, 968, 3265, 187, 5, 419, 4525, 29, 49803, 642, 15698, 50118, 41552, 642, 15698, 133, 165, 34, 351, 5, 13780, 968, 3265, 130, 498, 49803, 642, 8061, 50118, 41552, 642, 15698, 133, 165, 34, 351, 5, 13780, 968, 3265, 80, 498, 49138, 642, 15698, 50118, 8166, 640, 4339, 8303, 4, 175, 73, 119], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Richmond joined Hendrick Motorsports in 1986, where he teamed up with veteran crew chief Harry Hyde.

It took the team until the middle of the season to gel. Richmond had suffered a 64 @-@ race winless streak that was finally broken at the Van Scoy Diamond Mine 500 at Pocono in June 1986. After two straight second @-@ place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside, Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside the second row. That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point. NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track. It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps, and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields. Two hours later, the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third. After Richmond's car was adjusted to remove the \" push \", the car was more to his liking. Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left. Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end. After Richmond took the lead with 30 laps left in the race, Dale Earnhardt made up three seconds on Richmond's five @-@ second lead. With four laps to go, Buddy Arrington spun in a three @-@ car accident. The remaining laps of the race where completed slowly under caution and Richmond took the checkered flag for the victory. He had led 97 laps, including the final 30, taking his first victory in a Rick Hendrick car. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 2106, 1835, 7, 12912, 16405, 10, 353, 423, 6, 8, 7851, 12248, 13, 277, 1124, 11, 10, 11048, 787, 12, 1039, 30288, 515, 4, 96, 5, 507, 290, 787, 12, 1039, 6, 7851, 21, 3276, 7, 946, 160, 5, 849, 134, 5018, 6, 8, 5, 849, 176, 5018, 6, 11, 5, 849, 246, 5018, 6, 11, 5, 849, 306, 5018, 6, 11, 5, 849, 245, 5018, 6, 11, 5, 507, 849, 401, 5018, 6, 11, 5, 849, 406, 5018, 6, 11, 10, 507, 849, 398, 5018, 6, 11, 849, 466, 5018, 6, 8, 11, 5, 849, 698, 5018, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 7851, 165, 21, 441, 7, 946, 49, 308, 11, 5, 507, 290, 787, 111, 1039, 6, 53, 7851, 21, 3276, 7, 946, 160, 5, 849, 134, 5018, 6, 8, 5, 849, 176, 5018, 2156, 8, 5, 849, 246, 5018, 6, 11, 10, 507, 849, 398, 5018, 6, 11, 5], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The tour returned to Pocono a month later, and Richmond battled for another victory in a fog @-@ shortened event.

However, large wildfires in southeastern Oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range's vegetation, damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 24709, 11, 5, 22224, 5099, 17196, 32, 15517, 7, 5, 1737, 9, 5, 755, 15071, 4, 221, 47924, 4244, 32, 1537, 11, 5, 490, 6, 31235, 30241, 787, 12, 1039, 2913, 30, 5, 6964, 4, 252, 33, 41, 18225, 9, 6964, 293, 6, 8, 32, 182, 32836, 9, 5, 9776, 2147, 4, 252, 32, 67, 182, 32836, 9, 5, 9776, 1737, 4, 252, 32, 182, 32836, 9, 5, 9776, 1737, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 50118, 15483, 1721, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1721, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 328, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 50118, 133, 22224, 5099, 17196, 32, 10, 233, 9, 5, 755, 15071, 4, 20, 22224, 5099, 17196, 32, 10, 233, 9, 5, 755, 15071, 4, 20, 22224, 5099, 17196, 32, 233, 9, 5, 755, 15071, 4, 20, 22224, 5099, 16, 41], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Animals in the Trout Creek Mountains are adapted to the environment of the High Desert.
