Karzai told local residents that if they want to be protected, they have to bring their sons to the national army. \nThe significance of the rejection has to do with politics and Karzais failure to build a cabinet that spoke to a wide enough spectrum of people, and also with the weakening of his political machine, Alex Thier, the director of the Pakistan-Afghanistan program at the United States Institute of Peace, told The New York Times.\nThe American embassy released a statement saying that it supports the parliaments decision approve and disapprove the nominaees. \nAlso announced Saturday, Afghan parliamentary elections will take place May 22, despite corruption allegations from last Augusts presidential elections."

Both occupents of the Vauxhall, a man and a woman, were pronounced dead at the scene of the collision, which was on the A361 road in the town of Knowstone, near South Molton. The North Devon stretch of road was subsequently closed. It is suspected that icy conditions were a factor of the accident.\n\nTwo vehicles have been involved in a road traffic accident in the Western Isles of Scotland. As a result of the collision, which occurred at 0635 GMT on the Tarbert - Stornoway road on the island of Lewis on Saturday killed the sole occupant of one of the vehicles, who was a 26-year-old man. The Northern Constabulary, the police force in the Highlands and Islands, said that he came from the area. At least five people in the other vehicle were injured. The injured people were transported to Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway and were treated for abdominal, chest and neck injuries. The road was closed for several hours to allow police examinations to take place. Pentland Road, the alternative route round the area was also closed due to the snowy road conditions."

The Knights stepped up their offense with a 90 burst, bringing their score to 2516 at halftime. \nWheaton Academy didn't apply its usual full-court pressure, perhaps out of respect for Kasey Reaber's ball handling skills. They instead hoped to use a different defensive strategy. Of her game-high 18 points, Kasey Reaber scored ten in the third quarter, helping to give her team a 4026 lead at the end. The Knights' lead grew to 5030 in the fourth quarter.\n\"[Kasey Reaber] is just a phenomenal player. Her first step and that dribble penetration is hard to defend,\" said Wheaton Academy coach Beth Mitchell. Her tournament-MVP sister, Taylor Reaber, scored ten points during the game. Both Reabers are former students of Driscoll Catholic High School.\nAlexa Sharkey scored ten points for Wheaton Academy, and Meghan Grant nine. With a record of 122, the team was kept well below its average of 53 points per game in a contest. "

The find was made at Camp Denison.\nThe expedition is in Antarctica to help conserve huts used by the Australian explorer Douglas Mawson in the early twentieth century. The team unsuccessfully searched for the aircraft for three summers. The plane, which was a single-engine Vickers built in 1911, has been lost in the Antarctic ices since 1975. It was the first aircraft produced by the Vickers plant in France.\nBefore Mawson's 191114 expedition, the aircraft was damaged due to a crash. Mawson had apparently decided to use the machine as a motorised sled instead; however, the engine wouldn't function properly under very low temperatures, and the plane was later abandoned.\n\"[We've used a] Magnetometer, ground-penetrating radar, metal detectors and all sorts of things to try and look for it, but in the end it was just a combination of a very low tide, good weather and a thin ice melt,\" commented Tony Stewart, a member of the team, as quoted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \"Our carpenter was just taking a walk along the beach and just saw the metal in 10 centimetres of water, just right next to the ice.\"\n\"The ice melts back very quickly, it's on the edge of a harbour which is covered in sea ice most of the year and then as summer comes the edge of the ice gradually pulls off in huge chunks,\" he continued. \"This is the first time those rocks have been exposed in that area for some time so we've been walking around that area above the air tractor not knowing it was there under our feet all this time.\""

    "reference_text": "An axe-wielding Somali man attempted to break into the house of controversial cartoonist Kurt Westergaard on Friday night in what the Danish Security Intelligence Service called a terror-related attack. According to a statement by the agency, the attacker has close relations to the Somali terrorist group, al-Shabaab, and al-Qaeda leaders in eastern Africa. The man, whose name has yet to be released, was shot in the leg and hand after turning the axe on responding police officers. He was hospitalized but Aarhus police say that his condition is not life-threatening.\nThe cartoonist, 74-year-old Kurt Westergaard, published in 2005 a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad wearing a turban shaped like a bomb with a lit fuse. This, and 11 other cartoons published in Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, sparked the torching of Danish embassies in various Muslim countries.\nWestergaards five-year-old granddaughter was sleeping over at his house when a man wielding an axe and knife cracked a window, apparently setting off a house alarm. Westergaard, whose life has been threatened multiple times since publication of his cartoon, had prepared a bathroom to function as a safe room. While he and his granddaughter hid there, the attacker reportedly banged on the door, shouting revenge and blood. Police arrived in less than three minutes. Neither Westergaard nor his granddaughter were injured in the incident.\nThe attacker is now charged with the attempted murder of Westergaard and a police officer. My grandchild did fine, Westergaard told the Jyllands-Posten, It was scary. It was close. Really close. But we did it."

    "reference_text": "North Korea said in a statement on Friday that it wants to end its hostile relationship with the United States, and that it seeks to focus on six-party talks with the west. The statement released by major state run news outlets, said that the North is committed to \"a lasting peace system on the Korean peninsula.\"  The United States responded by saying that it will take the statement seriously if the North takes action on its word and returns to the six-party talks. \nThe Korean Peninsula has been split into North and South Korea since the Korean war, which ended in 1953 with a cease-fire agreement. The war between US led United Nations forces from the south and North Korean and Chinese forces. \nNorth Korea has been hit with sanctions since its nuclear test in May of 2009.  The sanctions hurt the North's already struggling economy.   \nAn expert on North Korean-US relations, B.R. Myers from Dongseo University, said that \"North has absolutely no interest in normalizing relations with the United States.  As soon as the North does that, it loses all reason to exist,\" and \"as soon as people think it is possible to get along with America, they will ask themselves why they need a 'military first' policy.\"  The nations leader Kim Jong-il said along with the statements, \"When the people's living standards are decisively improved, hooray for socialism and singing of Arirang of prosperity can ring out louder across the country and the gate to a prosperous nation be opened.\""

We had it for the meeting, and for the tournament,\" he said to the Associated Press news agency over the telephone.\nMalik Naveed, the provincial police chief, said to Voice of America that the attack may have been a retaliatory move against the residents of the town. According to him, the village where the attack occurred was once considered a hub of Taliban fighters; however, he says, locals, with the help of authorities set up a militia force and either killed or expelled them from their area.\n\"These insurgents, they were not very happy about it and they were cut off because the people had risen against them.  So this was one way of taking revenge from these people,\" Naveed said.\nThis incident is the deadliest attack in Pakistan since October 28 of last year, when 112 people were killed by a car bomb in the city of Peshawar."

China's GDP growth was 9.6% in 2008. Despite predictions about China's GDP being at around 8.6% to 9%, it rose to 9.6%, as stated by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected previously that China will overtake Japan soon since the latter's GDP dropped this year.\nThe big underlying factor propelling Chinas growth is the continued migration of people from the agricultural sector to the more modern economyindustry and services, said economist David Cohen. \nIn 2007 China became the third largest economy in the world when it overtook Germany.

    "reference_text": "About 300 new or amended laws took effect at midnight of New Year's Day last Friday in Illinois, ranging from government ethics reform to driving laws. \nOne law that is likely to affect residents' lives the most is a ban on reading or sending text messages through a hand-held device. Drivers who wish to text must put their vehicle on park or neutral while stopped in traffic or on the shoulder. The law also prohibits reading email or surfing the Internet, although using GPS capabilities is still allowed. Breaking this law is considered a primary offense, which means that law enforcement officers may pull violators over for it, similar to a seat belt violation.  \nMotorists also are prohibited from talking on their phones in a construction or school zone unless they are using earphones. Truck drivers outside the six-county Chicago area now have a speed limit of 65 mph, increased from 55 mph. In addition, injuring somebody while driving uninsured has become a misdemeanor, punishable with up to a year in jail or a $2,500 fine.  \nFormer governor Rod Blagojevich's removal from office has led to new legislation to reform state government as well. Changes to the state's Freedom of Information Act requires government agencies to respond more quickly to requests for information. The Illinois Attorney General also gets broad powers to oversee enforcement of this law. In addition, lobbyists will have to pay a $1,000 annual registration fee, up from $150$350. They will also have to report frequently on their activities and expenditures."

It is well established now, and the [unemployment] trend is down. We are now roughly in the zone which is consistent with the economy just beginning to add jobs,\" he said, as quoted by Voice of America.\nNot only are new job losses down, but the total number of people receiving unemployment benefits has also dropped by 57,000.  If the trend continues, the number of jobs created will outpace job losses, and US unemployment, which stands at a 26-year high of ten percent, will decline, according to Gault.\n\"We can look forward to 2010 with a lot more confidence that some of those jobs are going to come back,\" Gault said. \"They are not all going to come back quickly and maybe some of them will never come back. But we are going to start creating jobs.\"\nThe federal government will issue its next unemployment reading next week.\nThe improved unemployment numbers follow reports of a boost in US consumer confidence and indications that retailers fared better during the economically-critical holiday shopping season than had been anticipated."

    "reference_text": "A team of researchers from the Thomas Jefferson University's Biotechnology Foundation Laboratories (BFL) in the United States have managed to increase the amount of oil produced by tobacco leaves. Tobacco oil can be very efficiently converted to biofuel, but most oil is located in the seeds, which the plant does not produce many of.\nTobacco seeds produce around 40% oil per dry weight but a crop of the plant yields only around 600kg of seeds per acre.  The leaves have an oil content of around 1.74% oil per dry weight.  The oil has previously been tested for powering diesel-fueled vehicles and can be more efficiently converted than the product of many other crop plants.\nThe team from BFL identified that oil production in the leaves was controlled by two genes: the diacyglycerol acytransferase (DGAT) and the LEAFY COTYLEDON 2 (LEC2) genes. By genetic engineering, they achieved oil yields of 5.8% oil per dry weight by modifying the DGAT while changes to the LEC2 resulted in a yield of 6.8% per dry weight.\n\"Tobacco is very attractive as a biofuel because the idea is to use plants that aren't used in food production,\" said cancer biology assistant professor at Thomas Jefferson Dr Vyacheslav Andrianov, Ph.D. \"In some instances, the modified plants produced 20-fold more oil in the leaves.\" \nVarious efforts are being made to find biofuel sources that are not also potential food, in order to steer clear of causing further rises in global food costs. Last month the US government anounced funding for research that used nonphotosynthesising micro-organisms to manufacture biodiesel, in the hope that this will prove more efficient than options that rely on photosynthesis. This also escapes one criticism of biofuels like tobacco; that competition for land to grow crops on will result in biofuel crops displacing foodstuffs and pushing food prices up. In November 2009 a Spanish team launched a study to determine if tobacco, as well as the prickly pear, was capable of withstanding the harsh conditions of land not suitable for growing food, selecting these plants for their ability to survive water shortages."

However, fists went flying, in the first ever Winter Classic fight, between the Bruins' Shawn Thornton and the Flyers' Daniel Carcillo, who was looking to fight. Thornton said of the fight, \"It wasnt about that. He was out there and asked a couple guys. I dont think its anybody elses job to do that. Theres nobody on the team that has the same role as me. So I went and obliged.\" \nThornton added, \"Yeah, first one ever, I guess. Youve been reminding me about it for the last six months. It happened. Now its over and we can stop talking about it.\"\nThen at 4:42 in the second period, Danny Syvret, gave the Flyers their first point in what was Syvret's first goal of his NHL career. The game went in the third period with the Flyers leading, 1-0.\nHowever, the Bruins made a comeback in the third period on a power play, when former Flyer Mark Reechi tied the game 1-1 with 2:18 left in the period. The game went into \"extra innings\" at Fenway with both teams battling back forth until the very end with the Bruins' Marco Sturm gained control of the puck from the Flyers' Matt Carle hitting the puck to fellow teammate Patrice Bergeron. \nBergeron gained control of the puck and turned it to pass to Sturm who read Bergeron's movement. Sturm tipped the puck into net, winning the game for the Bruins at 3:03 in overtime driving the crowd in Fenway wild as the team swarmed Sturm to congratulate him.\nBruins' goalie Tim Thomas also achieved a dream of his as after the game concluded the United States men's national ice hockey team announced it's roster for the 2010 Winter Olympics which included the goalie. The team will play at 2010 Winter Olympics next month in Vancouver, British Columbia. \nHowever, the rink in Fenway won't come down just yet, Yesterday at 2PM EDT, the Bruins held the AT&T Legends Classic where former Bruins legends such as Cam Neely and Terry O'Reilly and current Bruins' coach Claude Julien were joined by celebrities such as Worcester, Massachusetts native actor and comedian Denis Leary, along with Kiefer Sutherland and film director Bobby Farrelly with groups facing off in two teams. The game was held despite the snow which has been forecast for the Boston area.\nThen, on January 8th, a double NCAA college hockey doubleheader will take place at Fenway Park as the women's ice hockey teams of the University of New Hampshire Wildcats and Northeastern University Huskies in the first ever outdoor women's ice hockey game. \nAfter that game ends, the infamous Green Line Rivalry will come to Fenway as long-time rivals, the 2008 NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Champions Boston College Eagles take on the 2009 champions, the Boston University Terriers."

I thought there was fighting again near our park station. Then I saw the mountain was on fire with sparks flying. We could see that we were not in immediate danger here at Rumangabo, but there are many people who live to the south of the volcano, where the lava is heading as I speak,\" he said, as quoted by CNN.\nMount Nyamuragira is located around 25 kilometres from Goma, a city with 600,000 residents. According to a posting on Mburanumwe's blog, however, it is unlikely that the city would be affected by the volcano's eruptions. The mountain rises to 10,333 feet above sea level, and over 35 eruptions from it have been recorded since 1882."

    "reference_text": "The United States and the United Kingdom closed their embassies in Yemen Sunday, pointing to ongoing terrorist threats.  The closures came after the two nations pledged to boost counter-terrorism support to the Yemeni government.  \nThe American embassy's website said the threats come from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the group linked to the failed Christmas Day airplane bombing attempt in the United States. The message in part said, \"The U.S. Embassy in Sanaa is closed today, January 3, 2010, in response to ongoing threats by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to attack American interests in Yemen.\"\nFurther adding, \"On December 31, the U.S. Embassy sent a warden message to Americans citizens in Yemen to remind them of the continuing threat of terrorist actions and violence against American citizens and interests throughout the world. The U.S. Embassy reminds U.S. citizens to maintain a high level of vigilance and to practice enhanced security awareness.\"\nDeputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism John O. Brennan said on CNN's State of the Union with John King, \"There are indications that al Qaeda is planning to carry out an attack against a target inside of Sana'a, possibly our embassy.\" Brennan added, \"And what we do is to take every measure possible to ensure the safety of our diplomats and citizens abroad, so the decision was made to close the embassy.\"\nA spokesperson for the British Foreign Office said their embassy would be closed on Sunday and a decision to reopen would be made on Monday.\nThe closures come a day after U.S. General David Petraeus visited the capital, Sana'a, to discuss security issues with President Ali Abdullah Saleh.  The general, who oversees the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, recently announced that the United States would more than double its security aid to the impoverished nation.\nThe United States gave $67 million last year to Yemen, the only country that receives more aid is Pakistan with $112 million, according to the Associated Press.\nYesterday, in his weekly radio address, President Barack Obama linked the suspect in the attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to al-Qaeda saying, \"We know that he traveled to Yemen, a country grappling with crushing poverty and deadly insurgencies. It appears that he joined an affiliate of al-Qaeda, and that this group, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, trained him, equipped him with those explosives and directed him to attack that plane headed for America.\"\nObama annouced, \"So, as President, I've made it a priority to strengthen our partnership with the Yemeni government-training and equipping their security forces, sharing intelligence and working with them to strike al-Qaeda terrorists.\"\nObama said that they had already results prior to the Christmas Day bombing attempt saying, \"So, as President, I've made it a priority to strengthen our partnership with the Yemeni government-training and equipping their security forces, sharing intelligence and working with them to strike al-Qaeda terrorists.\"\nBritain has also announced plans to join with the United States in funding a counter-terrorism police unit in Yemen, as well as plans to hold an international conference on Yemeni security later this month.\nEarlier today, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told the BBC, \"This is a new type of threat and it is from a new source which is obviously Yemen, but there are many other potential sources Somalia, as well as Afghanistan and Pakistan.\"\nEditor Hakim Almasmari, of the Yemen Post newspaper, thinks the conference might be advantageous if it results in more development projects for rural Yemen. However, he fears what any foreign-backed military attacks could mean. \n\"Al-Qaeda right now is not very strong,\" Almasmari said. \"Its followers are not more than 400 in all. However, if the U.S. does attack Yemen, al-Qaeda will get stronger and stronger because people who lose their families in the airstrikes will join al-Qaeda not because they want to but because they want revenge against the Americans and the Yemeni government for the attacks.\" \nThe situation has gained new urgency as the government in Sana'a finds itself overwhelmed not only by the growing terrorist threat, but also two separate rebellions, one of which has become something of a proxy war, at least in rhetoric, between Iran and Saudi Arabia.\nU.S. military experts have warned that vast reaches of the impoverished nation, with its booming population and dwindling resources, could spin permanently out of the government's control. \nMilitant groups from Somalia said that they would send fighters to help aid al-Qaeda in Yemen. Yemen has vowed to keep foreign extremists out.\nThe U.S. embassy has faced attacks from the local al-Qaeda group before, with an assault outside its gates in 2008 that left 19 people - civilians and militants - dead.

    "reference_text": "Media in the United States says a suicide bomber who attacked a Central Intelligence Agency base in eastern Afghanistan last week was a Jordanian working as an al-Qaeda double agent.\nThe reports say current and former Western intelligence officials identified the suicide bomber as Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, a 36-year-old physician and al-Qaeda sympathizer from Zarqa, Jordan.\nU.S. television network NBC says Jordanian authorities arrested al-Balawi more than a year ago and later recruited him to infiltrate al-Qaeda, believing he had been successfully reformed. Due to his medical background, it is believed his mission was to find and meet Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda's second-in-command. The CIA declined to comment on the reports.\nAccording to multiple sources, al-Balawi posted online in jihadist forums under the name Abu Dujanah al-Khurasani. One post by him read, \"When a fighter for God kills a U.S. soldier on the corner of a tank, the supporters of Jihad have killed tens of thousands of Americans through their connection to the opposition.\"\nJarret Brachman, consultant to the US government on terrorism said in a telephone interview to The New York Times, \"Hes one of the most revered authors on the jihadists' forums. Hes in the top five jihadists. He's one of the biggest guns out there.\"\nEvan Kohlmann, who tracks jihadi Web sites for NBC News said, \"He was actually an administrator on the now-defunct Al-Hesbah forum, previously al-Qaeda's main chat forum.\" \nThe bombing last Wednesday at the CIA base, known as Forward Operating Base Chapman, in Afghanistan's Khowst province killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian officer.\nThe U.S. military's intelligence chief in Afghanistan has criticized the work of U.S. intelligence agencies operating there, saying they are \"ignorant\" and out of touch with the Afghan people. General Michael Flynn says U.S. intelligence efforts have focused too much on gathering information about insurgent groups in Afghanistan. \nHe says U.S. intelligence has been unable to inform U.S. and NATO forces about the environment in which they operate and the Afghan people whom they seek to persuade. His comments were published in a report issued Monday by a U.S. think tank, the Center for a New American Security.\nThe bodies of the seven CIA employees killed in the Khowst attack arrived Monday at a U.S. Air Force base in the East Coast state of Delaware. A small, private ceremony was held at the base, attended by friends and family and CIA Director Leon Panetta.\nThe bombing was the second-deadliest attack in the U.S. intelligence agency's history. In a statement, CIA spokesman George Little described the fallen employees as \"patriots who courageously served their nation.\"\nIn message to employees the day after the bombing, Panetta said, \"Those who fell yesterday were far from home and close to the enemy, doing the hard work that must be done to protect our country from terrorism.\"\nJordan's state news agency, Petra, identified the Jordanian officer killed in the bombing as Sharif Ali bin Zaid. It says he was killed while \"performing the sacred duty of Jordanian forces in Afghanistan.\" NATO says Jordan has seven troops in Afghanistan.\nNBC News says Bin Zaid was an intelligence agent and a first cousin of Jordan's King Abdullah II. Both the Afghan Taliban and Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack."

This was the deadliest terrorist event of all the attacks of the year. A total Of course, the United Nation has issued an alert for the area.\nAccording a statement issued by UN Office Against the Violence, on December 31, 2009, the terrorist attacker, who allegedly attacked the embassy in Abu Bakr Abu Bakr, had stabbed Farouk Abdulmutalaba to his neck and then stabbed himself in the chest, killing",

The body scanners cost 100,000 (112k, US$160k) a unit and they will be implemented at all six of BAA's controlled airports. This came after Prime Minister of the UK, Gordon Brown, said that he was committed to using the controversial technologies. \n\"We've recognised that there are new forms of weapon that are being used by al-Qaeda, so we've got to respond accordingly. We will do everything in our power to tighten up on the security that is essential,\" said Brown to BBC News. Critics have said that the scanners are ineffective and would not have detected the weapons used in the Christmas day attack, and that they would create airport delays.\nThe BAA released a statement saying \"It is our view that a combination of technology, intelligence and passenger profiling will help build a more robust defence against the unpredictable and changing nature of the terrorist threat to aviation,\".\nShami Chakrabarti, director of the civil liberties group Liberty, said that the BAA should not profile saying, \"Has no one noticed the terrorists' ability to capitalise on discrimination, or the recruits from a range of different backgrounds? Whether on the street or at the terminal, suspicious behaviour is a sensible basis for search by policing professionals; race or religion is not.\"\nThe United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced new guidelines today about international travel to the United States. All passengers from targeted countries will have their carry-ons searched and be patted down, Politico reports. Travelers from all other nations will be searched randomly more often.\nThe targeted countries include Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya and Somalia. Other targeted countries were not revealed for security reasons.\nTSA spokeswoman Kristin Lee, said in a statement that the new measures go \"beyond simply looking at passports and now looks at itineraries from and through countries of interest...Because effective aviation security must begin beyond our borders, and as a result of extraordinary cooperation from our global aviation partners, TSA is mandating that every individual flying into the U.S. from anywhere in the world traveling from or through nations that are State sponsors of terrorism or countries of interest will be required to go through enhanced screening. The directive also increases the use of enhanced screening technologies and mandates threat-based and random screening for passengers on U.S. bound international flights.\"\nThe new regulations went into effect at midnight EST (05:00UTC) on January 4.\nThe Netherlands interior ministry announced December 30, 2009 that all passengers on commercial flights from the nation to the United States will have to be screened using the full body scanners. Originally U.S. officials advised Holland not to use such scanners due to privacy concerns, but now Guusje ter Horst said that \"all possible measures will be used on flights to the U.S.\" in the wake of recent events.\nNigeria will install full 3-D image scanners to all of its airports beginning this year. The suspected bomber from the Christmas day attack originated from an airport in Lagos Nigeria, which had full-body imaging machines which may have been able to pick up the bomb.\nThe Nigerian government has expressed discontent with the new U.S. regulations, saying that it will discriminate against the 150 million innocent Nigerians if they wish to travel to the U.S.."

The explosives were concealed so well that the man did not find them when he unpacked his bag at his apartment.\nOn Saturday, Slovak authorities planted contraband in passengers' luggage at Poprad's Poprad-Tatry Airport without the knowledge of passengers.  Seven of the eight items were recovered, while an eighth made its way to an apartment in Dublin.  Slovak authorities realised on Tuesday that one package of explosives were missing and notified Irish authorities who searched the man's apartment.\nDuring the search, parts of Dublin's inner-suburbs were sealed off and evacuated causing disruption to residents and businesses.  At the apartment authorities found the package and arrested the man under anti-terrorism laws; he was later released without charge after it was established he was innocent.\nThe man, a Slovakian electrician had been living in Ireland for some time. He was holidaying in Slovakia over Christmas.\nIreland's Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform issued a statement saying, \"Following contact earlier today from the Slovakian authorities with the Airport Police at Dublin Airport, members of the Garda Sochna have recovered a small quantity of explosive material from the luggage of a passenger who had flown into Dublin from that country on Saturday last.\"\nThe package contained 90 grams (3 ounces) of the plastic explosive RDX, also known as cyclonite or hexogen. According to Commandant Gavin Young, a spokesperson for the Irish Defense Forces, \"On their own, this type of explosive does need to be combined with other elements to make it into a bomb, but obviously this type of high-grade explosive is potentially extremely dangerous.\"\nSlovakia's Minister for the Interior Robert Kalinak has apologized to Irish Justice Minister Dermot Ahern over the incident and expressed his profound regret. Irish authorities are now investigating the incident and the government has ordered for a full report to be delivered.\nThe Irish Opposition has expressed concern about the incident. Labour Party spokesman Joe Costello said \"This incident led to the closure of roads in the area, the evacuation of businesses and the lives and safety of residents could have been put at risk. We also need to know what protest the government is going to make about this breach of our security.\""

The great fish was bought and then shared by the owners of a local sushi restaurant and a Hong Kong-based dining establishment. This tuna is the most expensive fish sold on record since 2001, when a 440-pound tuna was sold for over twenty-million ($220,000) at the very same market. \nWhen asked by local media outlets why he decided to purchase this giant tuna, the Hong Kong restaurateur said, \"I want[ed] to make an impact on the Japanese and Hong Kong economies by buying the highest-priced tuna.\"   \nThis locally caught tuna was among over two-thousand others bought and sold at this bustling fish market. Japan is the world's largest consumer of seafood per annum. With tuna being a major staple of their cuisine, the Japanese eat nearly eighty-percent of all commercially caught bluefin. \nHowever, tuna consumption in Japan has declined over recent years due to the change in the spending habits of its people as a result of economic downturns from the most recent recession.\n\"Consumers are shying away from eating tuna...We are very worried about the trend,\" a spokesperson for the Tsukiji market told the Associated Press. \nIn addition to the lack of demand and declining tuna stocks, fishermen and wholesalers worldwide are worried by the possibility of tighter fishing regulations that will be sanctioned and enforced by the Japanese government.  Despite this promise, many environmentalists say that this is not going far enough; they say that the only way to curb the inevitable extinction of the Pacific bluefin tuna is to initiate a trade ban on the fish altogether."

    "reference_text": "Television presenter and BBC Radio 2 disc jockey Jonathan Ross has announced his departure from the British Broadcasting Corporation. Ross currently presents his own chat show, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, as well as presenting his own programme and The Film programme on BBC Radio 2. He has decided to leave the corporation when his contract ends in July 2010. The contract was reported to have a value of 18,000,000 over the space of three years, however this has not been confirmed by the BBC.\nRoss, who has been working with the BBC since 1996, spoke to news reporters outside his house.  \"It's probably not a bad time for me to move on  and it's probably not a bad time for the BBC, either,\" he stated.  \"I've got six months left, I'm hoping to make the best shows of my career with them.\"  This information emerges one day after the announcement came that another BBC talk show host, Graham Norton, had signed a deal for two years with the BBC.  Rumours began to mount in the newspapers that Norton would soon take over Ross' television slot.  Alan Yentob, the BBC's Creative Director, said that \"[y]ou don't need to compare Graham with Jonathan Ross.  No decisions have been taken with that slot.\"  \nIn 2008, Ross was involved in the infamous incident involving Russell Brand and himself leaving obscene messages to actor Andrew Sachs via a voicemail service. Regarding his departure from the BBC, Jonathan said: \"Although I have had a wonderful time working for the BBC, and am very proud of the shows I have made while there, over the last two weeks I have decided not to re-negotiate when my current contract comes to an end. While there, I have worked with some of the nicest and most talented people in the industry and had the opportunity to interview some of the biggest stars in the world, and am grateful to the BBC for such a marvellous experience. I would like to make it perfectly clear that no negotiations ever took place and that my decision is not financially motivated. \n\"As I have said before  I would happily have stayed there for any fee they cared to offer, but there were other considerations.  I love making my Friday night talk show, my Saturday morning radio show and the Film Programme, and will miss them all.  Working at the BBC has been a tremendous privilege, and I would like to thank everyone who has watched and listened so loyally over the last 13 years.\""

He had been undergoing psychiatric evaluation at a federal prison in Butner, North Carolina in the months following the attack.

Von Brunn entered the museum when security guard Stephen Tyrone Johns opened the door for him. \nAuthorities said he then raised a .22-caliber rifle and shot Johns, who later died of his injuries at the George Washington University Hospital. Two security guards, Harry Weeks and Jason \"Mac\" McCuiston, returned fire, wounding von Brunn. According to police officers at the scene, a third person was injured by broken glass but refused treatment at the hospital.\nVon Brunn was vehemently anti-Semitic, saying that books like The Diary of Anne Frank were fabricated, and until the attack ran a anti-Semitic website called 'The Holy Western Empire'.  Prosecutors said that von Brunn wanted \"to send a message to the Jewish community\" that the Holocaust was a fraud and \"he wanted to be a martyr for his cause.\" \n\n\"Gunman kills one at Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.\"  Wikinews, June 10, 2009"

I'm very proud of the job I've done and the results delivered. But none of us is irreplaceable. None of us is indispensable.\"\nHe then went on to say, \"Over the past twelve months, I've managed four major pieces of legislation through the United States Congress, served as chair and acting chair of two major Senate committees, placing me at the center of the two most important issues of our timehealth care and reform of financial services.\" \nIn addition to highlighting some personal travails, Dodd alluded to his precarious political situation, \"I lost a beloved sister in July, and in August, Ted Kennedy. I battled cancer over the summer, and in the midst of all of this, found myself in the toughest political shape of my career.\" \nDespite this, Dodd adamantly maintained that none of the above reasons were the causes for his retirement. He said that his reasons were more \"personal,\" and that his retirement would hopefully give him a much-wanted opportunity to spend more time with his family.\nSenator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota announced that he would not run for re-election this year either. \n\"Although I still have a passion for public service and enjoy my work in the Senate, I have other interests and I have other things I would like to pursue outside of public life,\" said the sixty-seven-year-old, three-term senator who said he came to this decision after discussing his future with his immediate family over Christmas.\nGovernor of Colorado, Bill Ritter announced that he too would not seek a second term. The fifty-three-year-old freshman governor said that although he felt his race was \"absolutely winnable,\" after some deep \"soul searching,\" he realized that he truly wanted to retire from politics nonetheless. This due to the fact that he felt his main priority should be to be a better husband to his wife as well as a better father to their four children. \nWhen asked to comment on Senator Dodd's retirement on behalf of the Administration, Vice President Joseph Biden said Dodd would \"be long recognized as one of the most significant senators of my generation.\" \nHe furthermore stated, \"I believe the nation will miss his wisdom, wit and compassion. I count myself lucky because I know he's not going too far and will always be a source of advice and counsel.\" \nBiden gave similar comments and expressed like sentiments about the retirement of his other two Democratic colleagues as well.

The Times has also reported claims that former detainees have joined al-Qaeda on returning to Yemen.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) claimed U.S. authorities had cleared the release of about 35 Yemeni detainees at Guantanamo. Ben Wizner, ACLU staff attorney, said that \"the decision to halt all transfers of detainees to Yemen will prolong a shameful chapter in American history without making Americans any safer.\" He called the actions \"unwise and unjust\".\nHuman Rights Watch says it appreciates that Yemen poses a \"very difficult problem\" for the Obama administration. But, it says continuing to hold Yemenis at Guantanamo without charge \"only increases resentment against the United States and hands al-Qaida a recruiting tool.\"\nThe Center for Constitutional Rights called the decision \"unconscionable\". \"We know from the military's own records that most of the detainees at Guantanamo have no link to terrorism,\" the group said.\nMitch McConnell, Republican Party minority leader in the U.S. Senate, backed the move. \"Given the determined nature of the threat from al-Qaeda, it made little sense to transfer detainees from the secure facility at Guantanamo back to Yemen, where previously transferred detainees have escaped from prison and returned to al-Qaeda,\" he said.\nPresident Obama reiterated his pledge to shut down the Guantanamo prison, saying its existence helps al-Qaeda to recruit members and damages U.S. national security interests. Obama had said one year ago that he wanted to close the prison by 22 January this year, but recently admitted that this target would not be met. Guantanamo currently holds 198 prisoners, about half of them from Yemen."

Three days later, The Continuity IRA claimed responsibility for the murder of Police Service of Northern Ireland officer Stephen Carroll, who was shot by a sniper responding to a call.\nThere is also concern that the power-sharing government between Sinn Fin and the Democratic Unionist Party may collapse because of disagreements between the parties on the issue of transferring policing and justice powers from London."

    "reference_text": "Heisman trophy winner Mark Ingram scored a one-yard touchdown and Trent Richardson scored from two yards to cement the University of Alabama's first national American football title since 1992 in the 2010 BCS National Championship Game over the University of Texas at Austin yesterday in Pasadena, California. The Crimson Tide defeated the Longhorns 37-21.\nAfter a strong start by Texas, Alabama -- led by Greg McElroy -- went on the offense, leading by 24-6 at the end of the first half. Texas launched an impressive comeback bid to bring the score within three, but Alabama capitalized on two turnovers at the end of the fourth quarter to put the game away.\nFor the Crimson Tide, Ingram led all rushers with 116 yard and both he and Richardson had two touchdowns. For Texas Jordan Shipley led all receivers with 112 yards and two touchdowns. McElroy went 6/11 passing with 58 yards gained but was sacked several times. For Texas, Garrett Gilbert went 15/40 for 186 yards and two touchdowns, but was intercepted four times. On defense, Javier Arenas had two interceptions to lead all defenders.\nWith the win, Ingram became only the second Heisman winner to win the BCS national championship game in the same season. Also with the win, Alabama coach Nick Saban became the first coach to win two BCS national titles with two different schools. He previously won the title in 2003 with Louisiana State University.\nAfter the game, Ingram told ESPN that the national title has been a season-long goal for Alabama.\n\"The whole entire organization from the top to the bottom,\" Ingram said, \"we set that goal at the beginning at the season and worked towards it [...] I could not have done it by myself.\"\nIngram also told his father -- who is currently serving a prison sentence -- via the television broadcast that he loved him. Ingram's father played football for nine years in the NFL and was the 28th overall pick in the  1987 NFL Draft.\nOn the opening Texas possession, an injury to Texas starting quarterback Colt McCoy, who left the game, put true freshman Gilbert in charge of the Longhorn's offense.\nAfter the game, McCoy told ESPN that he \"[...] would haven given anything to be out there with [his] team.\"\nThe game, held annually in Pasadena, California, is the final college American football game in the country determines the national champion for the previous year's regular season. Both teams came into the game with perfect records and as the champions of their respective conferences, the SEC for Alabama and the Big 12 for Texas.\nFile:Colt McCoy - Fiesta Bowl - Jan 5 2009.jpg\nAfter winning the coin toss, Alabama elected to receive the ball. On fourth down in their first possession, Alabama attempted a fake punt, but Texas' Blake Giddeon intercepted the ball. A goal-line stop by Alabama forced a Texas field goal. However, the major news in Texas' first possession was an injury to Texas starting quarterback Colt McCoy, who left then game and later underwent X-rays on his right shoulder. McCoy was replaced by true freshman Garrett Gilbert. On the ensuing kickoff, Alabama again turns over the ball and Texas gets another field goal. In addition, Texas' defense came up strong, with three sacks in the first quarter.\nAlabama answered back on their next possession with a Mark Ingram touchdown to take the lead at the start of the second quarter. Alabama then forced a Texas three-and-out and received the ball on their own 47 yard line. The drive stalled after a sack of Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy and a Crimson Tide punt was taken by the Longhorn's Jordan Shipley at the Texas 15 yard line. Texas had no luck passing and had to punt, which Alabama returned to the Texas 51 yard line. On the second play from scrimmage, freshman Trent Richardson ran for a 49 yard touchdown, and after the extra point, a 14-6 Alabama lead.\nTexas hit back quickly with a 35-yard run to Alabama's 30 yard line and Gilbert went to the end zone with a pass, but the ball was dropped. Alabama got their first turnover of the game on a Gilbert interception on the next play, but could not capitalize, only managing to pin Texas within their five-yard-line on a punt. After two short runs, Gilbert could not hit Shipley for a first down pass, leaving Texas to punt. Alabama returned the punt to the Texas 29 yard line. Alabama kicker Leigh Tiffen hit a 26 yard field goal with 29 seconds left. However, the Tide were not done yet, as Marcell Dareus intercepted a Gilbert shovel pass and returned it 28 yards for the score and a 24-6 halftime lead.\nAt halftime, Texas coach Mack Brown told ESPN that he had chosen to go for a long field goal try to end the half and that the shovel pass was a routine one. Alabama coach Nick Saban told ESPN news that his team would not underestimate Texas in the second half, saying both teams needed to play 60 minutes of football. At the beginning of the second half, Brown told ESPN's Lisa Salters that McCoy would not return in the game.\nTexas received the ball first in the second half. After a first down, a Texas penalty forced a third-and-long, but Marquise Goodwin managed a 39-yard run for another first down. Texas could not advance the ball and punted into the end zone for a touchback. Texas' defence then forced a punt and received the ball at their own 34 yard line, before punting to Alabama who got the ball on their own 19 yard line. Texas then forced another punt, which Texas returned at the 47 yard line before punting again for an Alabama touchback. After a sack on McElroy, Alabama punted and Texas received on their 40 yard line. Texas finally broke the defensive battle when Gilbert hit Shipley for a 44 yard touchdown pass. After the extra point, Texas recovered on onside kick. Texas could not not get a first down, but managed to pin Alabama at their own 6 yard line as time wound down in the third quarter.\nAs the fourth quarter, the Crimson Tide marched down the field, helped by two personal fouls committed by Texas defenders. Kicker Leigh Tiffin then missed a 52 yard field goal, turning over the ball to Texas on downs. Gilbert hit several first downs and were helped by an Alabama penalty and Gilbert hit Shipley for another touchdown and a two-point conversion bringing Texas to within three points. On Alabama's ensuing possession, they are forced to punt and Texas gets the ball at the seven yard line.\nTexas' comeback bid was stopped when Gilbert was sacked and fumbled the ball, which Courtney Upshaw recovered for Alabama. Mark Ingram then scored on third down and Tiffin score the extra point. On the ensuing possession, Javier Arenas intercepted a Gilbert pass, which Alabama capitalized on with a one-yard Trent Richardson touchdown run. Tiffin's extra point attempt hit the upright to bring the score to 37-21. Texas could not respond as Gilbert was again intercepted. Alabama knelt the ball to end the game."

    "reference_text": "With violence against foreigners escalating daily, and after being deluged with various threats and demands from al-Shabaab, a radical Islamic militant group with ties to al-Qaeda, the United Nations World Food Programme announced on Tuesday that, as of the end of this week, they are going to suspend all of their operations within southern Somaliaincluding the distribution of desperately needed food aid to Somali civilians. This is now the third humanitarian agency, after CARE International and Doctors Without Borders, to evacuate from the war-torn nation. \nThe pull out, which will include the closing down of all UN offices and the withdrawal of all local staff, is going to effect over one million Somalismany of whom relay on this food program for their daily meals. \nWhen asked by the New York Times to further explain the UN's decision, Peter Smerdon, a spokesperson for the program, said via telephone from Nairobi, Kenya, \"In the past few weeks there has been a harder line of unacceptable demands and conditions set by armed groups (such as al-Shabaab) in these areas. We sadly had to make the decision to pull our staff out.\"\nSmerdon also cited the fact that over forty aid workers have been killed between January 2008 and September 2009, and that four volunteers still remain in the hands of their captors.\nFurthermore, when asked how this move by the UN will effect the Somali people, Smerdon said simply, \"People will go hungry...you could see malnutrition rates rising [as a result].\" When asked by a British newspaper, The Morning Star, the same question, another program representative, Emilia Casella, conveyed like sentiments, \"[Those] dependent on food assistance in southern Somalia face a situation that is particularly dire.\"\nIn a nation thatdue to civil warhas not had a functioning government in over two decades, Islamic extremists groupssuch as al-Shabaabas well as various warlords and pirate gangs control most of the Horn of Africa nation, except for its besieged capital, Mogadishu, which is protected by African Union and NATO troops in addition to UN peacekeepers.\nAccording to the UN, al-Shabaabwhich has direct influence over the area that is going to be effectedpresented their offices with numerous lists of demands. Among their demands was that the UN pay Shabaab a $20,000 protection fee every six months, seek Shabaab approval for all their projects, fire their entire female staff, and run their operations according to the militant group's schedule. \nWhen asked by The Associated Press about the UN's decision to leave southern Somaliaincluding his own town of JilibSomali civilian and father of eight children, Abdullahi Awnur, said that al-Shabaab is responsible for driving the UN food program away, and that what they are doing is \"indirect[ly] killing\" innocent people.\nAwnur went on to say, \"We have been forced to flee from our houses and depend on [UN] food aid, and now that it is finished, that means [al-Shabaab] here does not want us to live.\"\nDespite all that has been said, al-Shabaab spokesperson, Sheik Ali Mohamud Rage, told New York Times reporters that he found these claims to be \"baseless\" in their origins. He continued by stating that, \"All we (al-Shabaab) ordered them (the UN) was to buy food from Somali farmers and distribute it. They (the UN) do not want to do that, and because of that, they have made this very ridiculous justification.\" Nevertheless, the UN has noted that even when harvests were good, Somali farmers are only able to supply 30-40% of the food needed to sustain the bulk of the country's population. \n\"[Somalia] has been described as the most complex emergency in the world, and perhaps the most dangerous to operate in. However, the world is not hearing this,\" say David Gilmour director of CARE International's Somali branch."

He was on business in Hiroshima at the time of the first bombing on August sixth. His almost direct exposure to the atomic explosion temporarily blinded him, ruptured his ear drum (leaving him permanently deaf in his left ear), and severely burnt the top half of his body. Three days later, having gone back to work in Nagasaki, he was approximately three kilometers away from the site of the second bomb. Although he was exposed to significant radiation in this instance as well, Mr. Yamaguchi was left relatively unscathed.\nFollowing Japan's surrender and the end of the War days later, Mr. Yamaguchi worked as a translator for the occupying American forces and later as a local schoolmaster, before eventually returning to Mitsubishiwhich had since then become an automobile manufacturer. \nIn his later years, Mr. Yamaguchi became a respected lecturer who gave talks about his experiences, and publicly spoke out against the stockpiling of nuclear weapons. \nFor instance, in 2006, he addressed the United Nations General Assembly. \"Having been granted this miracle, it is my responsibility to pass on the truth to the people of the world,\" Mr. Yamaguchi said to the Assembly. He went on to say, \"My double radiation exposure is now an official government record. It can tell the younger generation the horrifying history of the atomic bombings even after I die.\"\nWhen asked by the British Broadcasting Corporation what his reaction was to Mr. Yamaguchi's death, the mayor of Nagasaki said that \"a precious storyteller has been lost.\"\nAmong the family and friends Mr. Yamaguchi left behind were his three adult childrenwho have also had health issues in their lifetimes thus far that they think may have be related to their father's initial exposure.

The bacteria found was a form of fecal contamination, it was discovered, although it was not immediately clear whether it came from the soda fountains themselves, or people with dirty hands.\nOther bacteria were also found in the soda samples, including E.coli, present in eleven percent of the tested beverages. Many of the soda drinks apparently fell below the US Environmental Protection Agency's minimum standards for drinking water; regulations state that samples cannot test positive for E.coli bacteria. In total, 20% of soda fountains had more than the maximum recommended levels of bacteria.\n\"The large number of beverages and soda fountain machines containing E. coli is still of considerable concern [...] and suggests that more pathogenic strains of bacteria could persist and thrive in soda fountain machines if introduced,\" the authors of the study wrote.\nRenee Godard, the study's lead author, and a professor of biology and environmental studies at Hollins University, commented on the findings. \"Certainly we come in contact with bacteria all the time. It's simply that some bacteria may potentially cause some disease or gastrointestinal distress. One thing we hesitate with is that people get afraid of bacteria. Many of them are benign or helpful, but certainly, I don't want E.coli in my beverage,\" she said.\nGodard and her team took samples of 90 different beverages from three groups - sugar soda, diet soda, water - from 30 fast-food restaurants in Roanoke, Virginia.\n\"You can get collections of bacteria in the water line and that then runs through the whole machine and gets in to the beverage. Any time any water or liquid sits somewhere, it's just a breeding ground for bacteria,\" commented Primary Care Physician Alanna Levine.\nExperts suggest that plastic nozzles used on soda fountains might be part of the reason why the study found so much bacteria is present; it takes only a single dirty hand to spread bacteria over a tube, and it could be easily transferred to the rest of the fountain from there. \n\"It could be from dispensing with a hand that wasn't clean or using wet rags to wipe down the machine. We haven't done the work to really identify those potential sources and how these bacteria get established,\" Godard said.\nA professor at the University of California Davis, however, said he believed that a single localised study wasn't enough to come to a conclusion about soda machines throughout the country. \"How sanitation regulations are promulgated and enforced in a community are different. Some communities are more on to it than others. How much of a threat it represents? It's probably limited. Once again, it's a matter of what regulations are in place, who pays attention and whether it's being followed,\" he said, as quoted by CNN.\nThe National Restaurant Association responded to the university's findings in an e-mail statement. \"While the results of this study are disconcerting, we feel that it isn't representative of our industry and that our guests can safely enjoy beverages from dispensers and single-serve containers alike,\" the organisation said.\nThe American Beverage Association also countered the findings. \"Fountain beverages are safe. Consumers can rest assured that our industry's fountain beverages pose no public health risk. [...] Importantly, our industry meets, and often exceeds, all government health standards in bringing its products to market.\""

The incident comes five days after an attack killed four Chevron employees.\nThe attacks caused Chevron to stop the production of 20,000 barrels of crude oil in the area.  Other attacks in the region have caused oil producers to pump little over two thirds of the total three million barrels-per-day capacity.\n\"We are still trying to unravel why it happened and who was behind [it],\" said an unnamed government official, as quoted by the Agence France-Presse news agency.\nAuthorities say it was not immediately known who was responsible for the attack. A group called the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) released a statement saying \"This attack was sanctioned by MEND, but did not involve our fighters.\""

The incident occurred at 20:00 local time (1800 UTC).\nThe bomb had apparently been planted in a bin in front of the Parliament building, and the detonation was so strong that it could be heard kilometres away. Approximately seventeen minutes before the explosion, Eleftherotypia, a national newspaper, received a phone call about the bomb, and the area had been cordoned off. This caused a major avenue in the centre of the capital to be closed, but prevented injuries when the blast occurred.\nThe Associated Press reports a history of similar actions by left-wing groups since the death of a fifteen year-old protester at the hands of police. Casualties are rare as telephone warnings are usually issued for bombings, and such bombings often occur late at night. The last year has, however, seen the death of one policeman and several others wounded."

No further details about the circumstances of Mr. Jiangs arrest and the overall status of the ongoing investigation have yet been provided. \nThis Thursday, at the behest of U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) released a surveillance video of what exactly had transpired. \nAccording to the tapes, a manallegedly Mr. Jiangwearing a light-colored jacket stood inside a rope barrier, and a guard approached him apparently telling him to stay within said security cordon.\nHowever, less than a minute later, the very same guard is allegedly shown leaving his assigned post, and disappearing into the sea of passengers. Following this, the man is accused of having slipped undetected underneath the barrier. He then is said to have met a departing woman, who appeared to have already passed through security. He then apparently proceeded to kiss her, before the two walked off holding hands. \nA bystander waiting for an arriving family member noticed the breach and told the guard. TSA officials then discovered that security cameras at the checkpoint were not fully operational, and consequently had not recorded what had occurred. As a result, investigators were forced to consult backup cameras maintained by Continental Airlines.\nIn an address to the media, Senator Lautenberg heavily praised the joint investigative team for their efforts. With this arrest, law enforcement will be able to take a closer look into how and why this incident occurred and make sure that it never happens again.\nThe guard in question is now on administrative leave, and could face possible disciplinary charges."

The arrests seem to be in connection with the investigation of Najibullah Zazi, who was also arrested in September on charges of trying to attack the subway system.  When Zazi was arrested in September, investigators said they knew the identities of at least three of his associates, but they did not release information about them.\nThe New York Times reports the two men and Zazi, who are all in their 20s, attended the same high school in the New York City area. Prosecutors have accused Zazi of conspiring to use homemade bombs against unspecified targets in the United States.  Law enforcement officials have said the plot may have involved New York City's mass transit system.\nThey allege Zazi spent more than a year plotting the attack with co-conspirators and that he received bomb-making instructions in Pakistan in 2008. The U.S. government also says he bought components to build improvised explosive devices and traveled to New York City on September 10, 2009, to move forward with his plans. Zazi's father was also arrested in September and charged with lying to federal officials."

The charges stem from an attempt to bomb a passenger jet as it neared the city of Detroit.\nThe charges include 289 counts of attempted murder, attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, willful attempt to destroy and wreck an aircraft within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States, willfully placing a destructive device in, upon and in proximity to an aircraft within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States, and two counts of possession of a firearm/destructive in furtherance of a crime of violence. If convicted Abdulmutallab faces life in prison.\nUS Attorney Barbara L. McQuade, said that \"The attempted murder of 289 innocent people merits the most serious charges available, and that's what we have charged in this indictment,\".\nNorthwest Flight 253 departed Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, the Netherlands on December 25 bound for Metro Airport in Detroit, Michigan. During the flight, Abdulmutallab allegedly attempted to use plastic explosives which consisted of of Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and Triacetone triperoxide (TATP) along with other ingredients  concealed in his undergarments to bring down the aircraft. The device apparently failed, resulting only in flames coming from his seat and loud popping sounds. \nPassenger Jasper Schuringa, along with others, restrained Abdulmutallab for the rest of the flight after which he was taken into custody by federal agents. The incident caused rapid changes in airport security around the world, and also in US intelligence services."

Michael McGimpsey, who is the Health Minister in Northern Ireland, announced: \"Sadly, we have been notified of a further swine flu related death in an adult. I would like to express my sincere sympathy to the family and would ask everyone to respect their privacy and allow them to grieve for their loved one in peace.\"\nDr. Elizabeth Mitchell, who is the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, talked about the H1N1 swine flu virus. She said: \"Swine flu has now been circulating within Northern Ireland since May 2009. We have seen two waves of infection from the virus and our planning and preparation has meant that the likelihood of a further wave has been significantly reduced. This is due in part to the extent in which the virus has already circulated in the community, and also as a result of the very successful vaccination programme in Northern Ireland. We know from experience of previous pandemics that flu viruses can be unpredictable so we can not completely rule out the possibility of a further wave. We will therefore continue to monitor the situation carefully and adapt our plans accordingly. The vaccine remains the best way to be protected against swine flu.\""

The building was only a few metres from another building that collapsed in October of last year, killing thirty people.\nThe building is reported to have been condemned last year, when the authorities deemed it substandard. Preparations to demolish the building started yesterday, in accordance with a court order that required the building to be destroyed within thirty days.\nOne of the casualties from the accident was Maina Irungu, aged seventeen; the other hasn't been identified. People wounded by the collapse were taken to the Kiambu District Hospital. The victims were all people who lived in houses near the collapsed building. Rescue operations are still ongoing, being conducted by the Red Cross, police, and military. Officials also ordered evacuation of two buildings in the vicinity when cracks were spotted on them, according to Capital FM Kenya.\nThis story in itself is reflective of a major infrastructure problem in Kenya, according to the BBC, China says it will give a US$7 million (4.4m, 4.9m) grant to help fund infrastructure development projects in Kenya."

    "reference_text": "Catherine Eugenia \"Jean\" Biden, mother of United States Vice President Joe Biden and matriarch of the Biden family, died Friday evening after suffering from a brief illness  possibly related to a recent hip fracture. She was 92 years-old.\nIn a statement to the Associated Press, the Vice President said his mother died at home in Wilmington, Delaware surrounded by family and friends.  Details of scheduled funeral services and memorials will be released in the upcoming days, the Vice Presidents Washington office said. \nJean Biden, whom the Vice President often quipped \"ran the show\" and taught him to believe in what he calls \"America's creed ... [how] everyone is your equal and nobody is better than you,\" was always a source of strength for Biden ever since he was a young working-class boy growing up Scranton.\nIn his autobiography, Joe Biden recalls, when in seventh-grade, being publicly mocked at school by a belligerent nun for his speech impediment. The current Vice President maintains that, upon hearing this, his mother went to the school, confronted the nun, telling her, \"If you ever speak to my son like that again, I'll come back and rip that bonnet right off your head! Do you understand me?\"\nHe also writes about how his mother, a devout Irish-Catholic, used her faith in comforting him after his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash in December 1972  the month he was elected to his first term as a Delaware Senator. He emotionally writes how, \"After the accident, she told me, 'Joey, God sends no cross that you cannot bear...'\" \nBiden also states that his mother taught him to have dignity, self-respect, and principle. On the subject he remembers how, in his youth, \"When[ever] I got knocked down by guys bigger than me, and this is the God's truth, she sent me back out [on] the street and told me, 'Bloody their nose so you can walk down the street the next day.' And that's what I did.'\"\nBiden said in a separate statement to the media, \"Together with my father, her husband of sixty-one years who passed away in 2002, we learned the dignity of hard work, and that you are defined by your sense of honor. Her strength, which was immeasurable, will live on in all of us.\"\nHe continued, \"She was the center of our family, and taught all of her children that family is to be treasured, loyalty is paramount, and faith will guide you through the tough times. She believed in us, and because of that, we believed in ourselves.\"\nJean Biden is survived by the Vice President, two other sons, her daughter, grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren."

    "reference_text": "Wolfgang Wodarg, a European health official, has said that the severity of the H1N1 swine flu pandemic was intentionally exaggerated by pharmaceutical companies so they could receive large profits.\nWodarg, who is the Council of Europe's head of health, claimed that the manufacturers of the anti-virus drugs pressured the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare a global pandemic over the outbreak. The Council said it would investigate the allegations in a debate scheduled for later in January.\nWodarg commented about his accusations to the Al Jazeera news agency. \"There is a very inefficient work of our agencies. They made a big panic with the bird flu and they made big panic with the swine flu. The national governments spent billions of euros to buy their vaccines [for H1N1] so we have to investigate what was behind it, we cannot afford such agencies that spent the money for useless health measures,\" he said.\nThe official also commented that \"it's just a normal kind of flu. It does not cause a tenth of deaths caused by the classic seasonal flu,\" as quoted by FOX News. \"The great campaign of panic we have seen provided a golden opportunity for representatives from labs who knew they would hit the jackpot in the case of a pandemic being declared.\"\n\"We want to clarify everything that brought about this massive operation of disinformation. We want to know who made decisions, on the basis of what evidence, and precisely how the influence of the pharmaceutical industry came to bear on the decision-making [...] A group of people in the WHO is associated very closely with the pharmaceutical industry.\"\nThe drug company GlaxoSmithKline responded to Wodarg's allegations. \"Allegations of undue influence are misguided and unfounded. The WHO declared that H1N1 swine flu met the criteria for a pandemic. Responding to it has required unprecedented collaboration. As WHO have stated, legal regulations and numerous safeguards are in place to manage possible conflicts of interest,\" it stated.\nSwine flu's impact across the world hasn't been as serious as was initially predicted, the Guardian reports; in the UK, up to 65,000 deaths from the virus were anticipated at the height of the scare, now the estimate is about a thousand, and the current death toll from H1N1 is 360. As a result, there is now a surplus of vaccines.\nDavid Salisbury, the Department of Health's director of immunisation, said that it hasn't yet been decided what to do with the UK's surplus of vaccine, although talks are underway. \"We have to keep a stockpile for ourselves because we simply don't know what is going to happen over 2010, and we know that there are proportions even within the risk group who have not been vaccinated. If there were a UK resurgence during 2010, we would look very foolish if we had disposed of a valuable stockpile.\""

Both Martinique, in the Caribbean, and French Guiana were granted French department status when France relinquished total control more than half a century ago.\nSupporters of greater autonomy, however, have argued that it would allow the territories greater say in key issues like development, education and employment.

    "reference_text": "United Airlines Flight 634 made an emergency landing yesterday morning when only two of the three landing wheels on the Airbus A319 deployed as the plane was making its final approach into Newark, New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport. After multiple attempts to fix the problem failed, the pilot decided that an emergency landing was the only remaining choice.\nOnly the plane's nose gear and left landing gear had descended. The right landing gear would not release. The airliner made a go-around as the crew attempted to fix the problem. Passenger Jim Falk knew something was wrong saying, \"Normally a big plane like that doesn't do a bypass, so we knew something was wrong.\" \nHowever, the pilot decided that nothing could be done to bring the gear down, and an emergency landing was declared.  \"We are going to have an unusual landing,\" the pilot calmly announced to the 53 passengers seated on the plane, according to passenger Moritz Loew. Another passenger, Paul Lasiuk said he was more shocked than scared, telling himself, \"You have no choice.  You're going to go through this.\"\n\"Brace! Brace! Brace!\", the pilot announced over the plane's public address system, calling for passengers to enter the brace position as the plane made a touchdown on the runway at Newark. The plane touched down on the nose wheel and left rear wheel before lurching to the right causing sparks to fly as the right engine skidded along the runway. Eventually, the plane came to stop at 9:27 A.M. EDT.\nAfterward, passengers and crew evacuated the plane by sliding down the evacuation slides and moving quickly away from the plane. They were then taken by bus to the airline's lounge where they told their stories to investigators and waited for their luggage. Three passengers reported minor injuries but refused treatment.\nThe emergency landing caused the airport to shut down for 20 minutes, but service quickly resumed on two of the airports three runways. The plane remained on the runway throughout the afternoon as investigators determined the cause of the landing gear failure. \nThis is in contrast to last week, when the airport was shutdown for six hours after a young man named Haisong Jiang breached security by passing through an exit to kiss his girlfriend goodbye.\nAccording to passengers, the crew remained calm during the ordeal. Jim Falk said, \"They did a great job. There was no yelling, screaming, panicking or anything.\" Falk said he wanted to buy a bottle of champagne for the currently unnamed pilot. Falk added, \"The pilot did a beautiful job. He didnt put it in the water like the other pilot did, but he should be commended.\" \nMartin Trebino, a spokesperson for United Airlines said they would not release the pilot's name on Sunday, but did not indicate when his name would be made available either.\nPaul Lasiuk said, \"I've had a lot of worse landings at Newark before. It was unbelievably smooth.\"\nMoritz Loew joked with himself afterward saying, \"What's a great landing? One that you walk away from.\"\nThe flight, which left Chicago's O'Hare International Airport early Sunday morning around 6 A.M. reported no other problems during the flight up until the incident. According to United Airlines spokesperson Robin Urbanski, it remains unclear why the landing gear failed to deploy. Urbanski added that passengers' tickets would be refunded and that they would receive vouchers and credit towards any future flight."

    "reference_text": "After a very close offensive battle throughout the game, the Arizona Cardinals defeated the Green Bay Packers 51-45 in an overtime thriller today in the wild card round of the NFL Playoffs. The game was won after Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers fumbled the ball during overtime, resulting in Arizona's Karlos Dansby recovering the ball and returning it for a touchdown, giving the Cardinals the sudden death victory. Arizona coach Ken Whisenhunt called the contest \"...Probably one of the best games ever played in the playoffs\", while Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy said that it was \"The toughest loss I've ever been a part of.\" Both team's strong offenses were evident throughout the entire game. The two team's offensive totals combined to reach a massive 1,024 yards, with the Cardinals gaining 531 and the Packers 493. \nIn the first quarter, the Cardinals got out to a quick start, when cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie intercepted an errant Rodgers throw and returned it for a touchdown. On Green Bay's very next possession, wide receiver Donald Driver fumbled, setting up another quick Arizona touchdown and making the score 14-0 in favor of the Cardinals. An Arizona field goal by Neil Rackers made it a 17-0 lead at the end of the first quarter.\nThe Packers began to show some of their offensive firepower in the second quarter. To start the quarter, Rodgers led the team down the field in a 52-yard drive that lead to a Rodgers sneak at the goal line to give the Packers their first points of the game. However, the Cardinals quickly countered with a scoring drive of their own, capped off by a 15-yard passing touchdown from quarterback Kurt Warner to receiver Early Doucet. At the end of the half, Green Bay kicked a field goal to cut into the deficit which was still quite large, a 24-10 halftime edge for Arizona. \nWarner and Rodgers both showed explosive passing throughout the next half. In the third, both quarterbacks threw two touchdown passes to make the score 38-24, the Cardinals still holding the edge. Green Bay began to mount their comeback in the fourth quarter. They began with two touchdowns, tying the game at 38. Warner again countered with another passing score for Arizona, giving them a one touchdown edge with under 3 minutes to play. Then, Rodgers led the Packers in a quick drive, scoring and tying the game at 45 all. The match now had to be decided in overtime.\nGreen Bay won the overtime coin toss, giving them the advantage of having the ball first in the sudden death period. However, the key mistake of the game came here. On the Packers' third play, Aaron Rodgers fumbled, creating a Karlos Dansby recovery which he returned for a touchdown, ending the offensive shootout with a final score of 51-45.\nAfter the win, Arizona is now focused on advancing further in the playoffs, as well as rumors on Warner's possible retirement. \"I don't think you every want to stay too long, but you never want to go out before it's time,\" said Warner. \"The hard part is trying to figure that out, but right now it's about another playoff game. It's about New Orleans and then we'll go from there.\"\nThe Cardinals play the New Orleans Saints in next week's divisional round."

    "reference_text": "Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who is US Senate Majority leader, is under a lot of criticism over comments he made during the 2008 United States presidential election, toward US President Barack Obama. The highlighted comment made by Reid was calling Obama a \"light-skinned\" black man \"with no Negro dialect unless he wanted to have one.\" The remarks were released in a book co-written by Time magazine reporter Mark Halperin, and New York magazine reporter John Heileman. \nReid has since apologized for \"using such a poor choice of words.\"  President Obama quickly accepted the apology.  Reid has been a partner with the Obama Administration on issues such as health care reform.  Democratic Party chairman Tim Kaine told Meet the Press \"the comments were unfortunate and they were insensitive\", but \"I think the case is closed because President Obama has spoken directly with the leader [Reid] and accepted his apology. [...] We're moving on.\"\nMembers of the Republican Party have called on Reid to resign over his comments. Party chairperson Michael Steele told Fox News Sunday \"There is this standard where the Democrats feel that they can say these things and they can apologize when it ... comes from the mouths of their own. But if it comes from anyone else, it's racism,\". Having appeared alongside Kaine, where the Democrat Party chairman stated the case was closed, Steele argued that there was a double standard, on the basis of then-Senator Obama calling in 2002 calling for Trent Lott, at that time the majority leader, to be ousted for supporting the views of Strom Thurmond, who stood as a segregationist Presidential candidate in 1948.\nThe book Game Change published today, also says that New York Senator Chuck Schumer encouraged Barack Obama to run in early 2006, even though he later endorsed his former colleague Hillary Clinton. Other revelations included that John McCain's aides were concerned about Sarah Palin's failure to understand basic facts prior to her ABC News interviews with Charles Gibson, including why North Korea and South Korea are separate countries.\nCo-authors Halpern and Heileman have a history of vocal criticism of media coverage of the 2008 Presidential election. In late 2008, Daily Kos reporter Jed Lewison drew attention to comments by Halpern, on-stage with Heilmen, asserting the reportage was, \"extreme bias, extreme pro-Obama coverage\"; he characterised election coverage as, \"the most disgusting failure of people in our business since the Iraq war\". Halpern's centrepiece example was an analysis of New York Times profiles on the prospective First Ladies; overlooking earlier NYT coverage that reported on Obama's Caucasian ancestors being slave owners."

It added that it is fast running out of space and money to care for them.  \n\"We now estimate that some 200,000 people have been displaced by the conflict in Yemen since 2004, including those displaced by the latest escalation which erupted in early August last year,\" said UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic.\n\"These newly displaced people bring stories of intense clashes in Razeh, Saqain and Sahar districts and report dozens of civilian casualties as a result of air strikes and heavy fighting,\" Mahecic added, as quoted by Voice of America. \"UNHCR is not present in the conflict area and has no independent confirmation of these reports.\n\"We now estimate that some 200,000 people have been affected by the conflict in Yemen since 2004, including those displaced by the latest escalation which erupted in early August last year,\" he continued.\nThe spokesman noted that camps for the displaced are stretched to capacity, and aid resources are quickly becoming depleted. News24 reports that one camp at Al Mazrak in the Hajjah province is now home to 21,000 people, double its intended capacity, and others were also being populated quickly and in dire conditions.\n\"The shelter situation is equally dire in Amran province where most of the arriving IDPs are staying with host families or renting places.  Over the New Year's week alone, more than 5,000 IDPs arrived to Amran City,\" Mahecic said.  \"The acute lack of shelter and accommodation is creating tensions between the displaced and the local population.  In the absence of an immediate and feasible camp option, UNHCR is planning to set up a transit center in Amran as an interim and temporary solution,\" he concluded.  \nThe UN has issued a US$177-million appeal on behalf of all UN agencies working in Yemen; so far, less than one percent of that has been received."

On July 22, 2008, Bartlett police officers and federal agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement executed a search warrant on his home and seized his computers. He was later arrested on December 10 and was charged with two Class 3 felony counts of possession of child pornography. He posted the minimum 10% of his US$100,000 bond and was released from the DuPage County jail the next day, when he effectively resigned from his post on the park district board. He pleaded guilty to one of the two counts on November 30, 2009.\nThe crime apparently did not use park district computers. Mr. Rowe was first elected to the board in 2001 and was reelected to a second six-year term in 2007. A background check done on him after his election revealed no previous criminal record. "

It is capable of carrying conventional payload of 15 kilograms. The missile has a solid-propellant engine and is capable of achieving speeds of around Mach 4, four times the speed of sound. \nThe missile which has a range of 25 km (15 miles) can be fitted into any fighter aircraft.  It is intended to be eventually integrated with the IAF's Sukhoi-30MKI, MiG-29, Mirage 2000, Jaguar, and the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft. \nS.P. Das, head of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) in Orissa said \"It was a very good flight. The test was conducted to prove the control system,\" after the missile hit targets accurately.\nSources at the ITR claimed the tests on the missile's navigation, control, air frame, propulsion and other sub-system have been validated.The complex missile system would undergo some more trials before being made fully operational. They hope to introduce it in India's arsenal by 2011."

The bill specifies that only certain chronic diseases are eligible, ALS, AIDS, cancer, muscular dystrophy, and multiple sclerosis. The bill specifically bans the unlicensed growing of cannabis, driving under the influence of the drug, and only allows six licensed dispensaries in the state. \nOne of the supporters of the bill, Assemblyman Reed Gusciora said that I truly believe this will become a model for other states because it balances the compassionate use of medical marijuana while limiting the number of ailments that a physician can prescribe it for.\nOpponents of the bill point to California where they say that cannabis is too loosely regulated. Governor-elect Chris Christie said that \"I think we all see whats happened in California,\" he said. \"Its gotten completely out of control.\""

The deal is effective immediately, and Palin will reportedly contribute regularly to all Fox stations. The monetary terms to the deal have not yet been disclosed, but the agreement is rumored to be for three years.\n\"Governor Palin has captivated everyone on both sides of the political spectrum...,\" said Bill Shine, Fox News's vice president of programing,\"We are excited to add her dynamic voice to the Fox News lineup,\" he added in his comments.\nAs well as contributing, Palin will also be hosting a new program slated to air on Fox News. Called Real American Stories, the series will portray stories of overcoming obstacles during current times and through current social or economic problems that may be going on at the time. The series has no planned release date, but will air sometime within 2010.\nPalin released a statement herself Monday afternoon. \"I am thrilled to be joining the great talent and management team at Fox News. It's wonderful to be part of a place that so values fair and balanced news,\" she said.\nAfter serving as mayor of the town of Wasilla, Palin was elected governor of Alaska in 2006. U.S. Republican candidate John McCain picked Palin to serve as his running mate in the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, where she and McCain lost to Democrat Barack Obama and his running mate Joe Biden. In July 2009, she resigned from the governor position of Alaska governor, possibly opening up a run for U.S. president in 2012."

    "reference_text": "The U.S.-based multibillion dollar online search engine, Google Incorporated, has announced Tuesday in a public statement on its official blog that the company has been the victim of a \"highly sophisticated\" and \"targeted attack\" against their corporate infrastructure that they allege \"originated from China.\" \nThe author of said statement, David Drummond, Google's Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Chief Legal Officer, noted that Google was not the only multinational corporation targeted.  \"As part of our investigation we have discovered that at least twenty other large companies from a wide range of businessesincluding the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectorshave been similarly targeted.\"  The names of these other corporations in question have yet to be released.  To this end, Google states that they are \"currently in the process of notifying these companies,\" and they are cooperating with the \"relevant authorities.\"\nDrummond goes on to say that through a separate and unrelated investigation, Google has additionally discovered that the accounts of \"dozens\" of Gmail users worldwide who are \"advocates\" of political and human rights in China \"appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties\" as well.\nHowever, he affirms that \"...these accounts have not been accessed through any security breach at Google, but most likely via phishing scams or malware placed on the users computers.\"\nAs a result of what has occurred here, Google said it has already made significant changes to the security infrastructure of its users' accounts as to prevent something like this from ever happening again.\nAt the same time, Google advised individual users to use more discretion while online, \"We would advise people to deploy reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on their computers, to install patches for their operating systems and to update their web browsers. Always be cautious when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and emails, or when asked to share personal information like passwords.\"\n\nGoogle launched its Chinese-language search engine, Google.cn, in January 2006. The only precondition to operating in China was that the company had to acquiesce to certain censorship demands from the one-party government. When defending their controversial rationale for operating in the socialist republic, Google said \"that the benefits of increased access to information for people in China, and a more open Internet outweighed our discomfort in agreeing to censor some results.\" \nNevertheless, Google has still been widely criticized for this voluntary censorship of search results of topics, such as the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, movements for Tibetan and Taiwan independence, and the Falun Gong religious movement along with other information considered harmful to the Chinese government. Some feel it goes against and is hypocritical of Google's informal motto, \"Don't be evil\".\nIn response, a spokesperson for the Chinese Consulate in New York City, Wenqi Gao, said in a phone interview to The New York Times, I want to reaffirm that China is committed to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign companies in our country.\nIn contrast, Sharon Hom, the executive director of Human Rights in China said, \"It's a wakeup call for the international community about the risks of doing business in China. The tendency has been for companies to keep their eye just on the benefits of doing business. But the risks are realThe risks are to our intellectual property. The risks are to our values.\"\nAnalysts noted that this move has the potential to financially hurt Google, which has a somewhat limited share of the Internet search market in China, which is dominated by the Chinese-based Google-like website Baidu. Google's shares fell just under two percent after hours to US$579.50. Meanwhile, Baidu shares rose five percent to US$406.\nHarvard Business School professor David Yoffie said, \"The consequences of not playing the China market could be very big for any company, but particularly for an Internet company that makes its money from advertising.\"\n\"It will hurt their profits. They get eight to ten percent of their revenues from China,\" said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst for Global Equities Research. \"If they walk, they will eventually be invited back into China, because the Chinese people will request that. Openness always wins, but it will take some time.\"\nTim Ghriskey, the chief investment officer for Solaris Asset Management said, \"Clearly not good news for Google and clearly not good news for consumers. You've got to think that eventually Google figures out a way to deal with this. If they do have to shut down their Chinese operations, that they would be able to reinstate them. Hopefully soon. I can't imagine that this would be permanent.\" He added, \"China is a great growth engine for every business. It is a great opportunity for Google as well.\"\nIn response to all that has happened and what has been said, Drummond explains that this has \"led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China.\"\nHe goes on to state, \"We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.\"\nDrummond concludes his statement by trying to assuage the situation the best he can, \"The decision to review our business operations in China has been incredibly hard, and we know that it will have potentially far-reaching consequencesWe are committed to working responsibly to resolve the very difficult issues raised.\""

The tiny Islamic group has since won much publicity in Britain by threatening to carry out controversial demonstrations.\nLast week, the group announced plans for a march through Wooton Basset, a small market town where British soldiers killed in Afghanistan are honored, but the demonstration was called off earlier today.\nAccording to the UK Home Office, fifteen people have been convicted of criminal offenses related to banned groups since 2001. A total of 45 groups are listed on the Home Office Web site as banned under the Terrorism Act."

    "gen_text": "An international court in Strasbourg issued a ruling yesterday that powers allowing UK police to stop and search anyone without reason are in breach of European law. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)' verdict comes as Britain's Supreme Electoral Commission said it has ruled that the powers granted on the grounds that they can be taken away without legal justification. \"The ECUR has found that a person who is not a member, has an obligation to be able (without a reason). The ECUR's decision does this by finding that the powers granted on the grounds that it can reasonably allow such a law, without justification, are in the breach and not in the interest of the public\". It added that this was a significant decision to be \"in favour... the right to liberty and of justice\".\nAdvertisement This",
    "reference_text": "An international court in Strasbourg issued a ruling yesterday that powers allowing UK police to stop and search anyone without reason are in breach of European law. The European Court of Human Rights deemed powers contained in the Terrorism Act 2000 denied the human right of privacy.\nUnder the European Convention of Human Rights people in the UK are granted the right to privacy, although their government felt that the threat of terrorism meant that the breach of this was justifiable and allowable under exemptions in the Convention. Previously, the powers have been unsuccessfully challenged before the English and Welsh High Court, upheld by those nations' Court of Appeals and finally upheld again before the UK's House of Lords.\nSection 44 of the Terrorism Act allows the Home Secretary to designate an area for use of the powers for a certain period. If this period was more than a month then at the end of the month then the Home Secretary can renew them. The entirety of Greater London has spent several years with the powers in effect. Under the Act, the police do not need to have any reason to search whoever they like and have the power to confiscate articles they believe to be of use to terrorists. They can also make arrests if these are found.\nYesterday's ruling was made in a case brought by Kevin Gillan and Pennie Quinton, both stopped outside a military exhibition in London's Docklands area. Gillan was stopped while cycling past and kept there for twenty minutes while journalist Quinton was ordered to stop filming even after showing her press card. She claims to have been detained for roughly thirty minutes at the scene, while police claim she was there for five minutes. The court awarded 33,850 (30,400) to cover the costs incurred by bringing the case.\nUK Home Secretary Alan Johnson expressed disappointment at the ruling and stated that an appeal will be launched. Chief Constable Craig Mackey of the Association of Chief Police Officers said that while this appeal was pending Section 44 of the Act would continue to be used  by police.\nThe court found that the humiliation and embarrassment of searching  people in public was a clear breach of privacy as well as criticising that the way power was authorised did not require a test that its use be \"necessary,\" merely \"expedient.\" The court singled out London's designation under the Act as an area where the powers could be used continuously since it became law as an example of why this was not appropriate.\nFurther criticism in the ruling was aimed at the idea that the decision to search could be \"based exclusively on the 'hunch' or 'professional intuition' of the police officer\". The judgement added that \"the absence of any obligation on the part of the officer to show a reasonable suspicion made it almost impossible to prove that the power had been improperly exercised,\" with no judicial oversight. Racism was a further concern, with the court expressing a fear that the powers could easily be used in a discrimminatory manner. Four times as many blacks and Asians have been searched compared to whites."

The man immediately notified security, and local police were soon called to the scene. From there, the bag's contents were tested, and the results came back positive for cocaine.\nThe center's director, Robert Cabana, assured the press that neither the Discovery nor the hangar in which it is being housed was compromised by the presence of the illegal drug. He went on to affirm that neither he nor his agency condone the use of any controlled substance by any employee while they are on the job, and that whoever is responsible will be fired and then prosecuted for the offenses. \nFurthermore, Cabana stated that besides probing the criminal nature of what occurred, NASA will also conduct a full review of recent work performed on the Discovery as to make sure that there were not any other potential problems with the shuttle that investigators may have missed the first time.\nAlthough a drug test was performed on each of the facility's over two-hundred workers before they left Wednesday, \"There was nothing obvious,\" said the center's public relations spokesman, Allard Beutel. \nHe goes on to say, \"Nobody was obviously under the influence when they were working, because we have supervisors there, security in there. It wasn't obvious somebody was under the influence of this substance, or any other, for that matter.\" \nSenator Bill Nelson, a former astronaut himself, says he is confident that the guilty party will be found, brought to justice, and then sent \"out the door.\"\nBeutel concluded his statement by reaffirming NASA's \"zero-tolerance\" policy for controlled substances, \"People know how serious this is, and how serious[sic] people take it,\" Beutel said. \"And it's not acceptable.

However, that found on curvy bums, thighs and hips actually traps fatty acids, as well as being associated with a reduced risk of diabetes and heart conditions. It releases hormones that help control blood sugar levels and keep arteries in good condition by preventing blockages with an anti-inflammatory. \nBelly fat releases inflammatory substances called cytokines and it is these that are trapped by the fat on curvy hips, bottoms and thighs. Cytokines also latch upon muscles and the liver, and can cause resistance to insulin, an important chemical. A lack of fat in the areas identified can also lead to metabolic chaos such as that which occurs in Cushing's syndrome.\n\"The idea that body fat distribution is important to health has been known for some time,\" explained Manolopoulos \"However is it only very recently that thigh fat and a larger hip circumference have been shown to promote health, that lower body fat is protective by itself.\" He stated that future research might even seek ways to ensure people have a healthy layer of fatty curves and that further study may be required to better understand the health effects."

    "reference_text": "Digital radio listeners in the UK may have noticed a new station on their list over the last few months with the beta launch of Amazing Radio, founded by Paul Campbell as a follow up and companion to Amazing Tunes.  However, unlike the majority of the other stations on both digital and FM, Amazing Radio doesn't play normal, mainstream music.  Instead, its playlist consists solely of music from unsigned bands and artists who have signed up and uploaded their music to AmazingTunes.com.  Their music can then be downloaded from the site, for which they get paid.  The more downloads and interest an artist receives, the more likely they are to get played on the national radio station.  Amazing markets itself as an \"ethical\" download website, on which artists get 70% of the download revenues.  They now have more than 22,000 songs uploaded, with about 100 uploaded every day.  \nPaul Campbell himself has extensive experience in both radio and television production, having worked for BBC Radio 4 and Channel 4.  After success with his own production company in the nineties and with support from investors, Campbell launched Amazing Tunes in 2005.\nAs Amazing Radio introduces a new schedule for the New Year, with presenters rather than solely pre-recorded links, Wikinews reporter Tristan Thomas interviewed Campbell to find out more.\n((Wikinews)) Hi Paul, thanks for doing this interview.\n((Paul Campbell)) My pleasure  thanks very much for asking me.  Were really grateful that Wikinews is interested in us.\n((WN)) At the end of 2009, you complained to the BBC Trust about BBC Introducing.  Can you explain what this was about and the reasons for it.  Has anything come of it?\n((PC)) Sure: in a nutshell, the complaint was about unfair competition - about the BBC not following its own rules.  Its still ongoing. It will take, ahem, a while to resolve. \nThe details are a bit complex, but here goes.  (If you commit suicide out of the boredom at what follows, I apologise). \nAs British readers will know, the BBC has a guaranteed and very comfortable income derived from the Licence Fee - effectively a tax you have to pay if you want a TV.  According to Wikipedia (so it must be true), this generates an income to the BBC of about stg4.5bn per annum.  Nice. \nNot really.  In recent years the beeb has increasingly used this gargantuan income - and its incredible audience reach online, on radio & TV - to launch new services that make life impossible for everyone who is not the BBC.  These have ranged from e-learning content (that completely wrecked the market for private publishers), to a new digital radio station (that caused a private speech station to go bust), to an attempt to launch online regional news services (which caused howls of outrage from local newspapers).  The BBC does it for the best of reasons  to provide a public service  but BBC people live in an insulated, publicly-funded world, one where you know with complete certainty youll get paid on the 15th of every month. Its a million miles away from the real world, where entrepreneurial people take risks, and lose their jobs and their houses if it goes wrong.  Here, the BBCs actions have grave implications.  And not just for private companies: the UK as a whole is very good at creative industries, which are the fastest-growing part of the economy. But its kinda hard to grow a global business if your domestic market has been wrecked by a rampaging, publicly-funded, bull in a china shop.  So by accidentally knackering private companies, the BBC is also damaging the British economy.  \nWise people noticed this.  A few years ago the Governance of the BBC was changed.  A new regulator, the BBC Trust, was created.  It tried to address the problem.  It insists the Corporation does a 'public value test' when it wants to launch a new service, or to expand an existing one.\nHere, it hasn't.  Although the BBC has a longstanding commitment to play new music on its local radio stations, and one of its most famous DJs John Peel had an outstanding show on BBC Radio 1 for many years which played new music (and was, incidentally, produced by one of our new presenters), it's suddenly changed the game.  Its launched a huge expansion and automation of this formerly piecemeal and limited activity, targeted exclusively at unsigned bands. BBC Introducing is a pan-BBC brand, combining local and network radio, television, online, even a special stage at Glastonbury.  There's a very expensive online upload service which I just know would have cost ten times what we had to spend on our similar service. There's a Head of Department, doubtless with dozens of staff.  Ill bet they have BBC Introducing pens.  It's everywhere. \nThis is, by any reckoning, a new service.  But its not been subjected to a public value test.  Worse, I have it on very good authority from someone inside the BBC that BBC Worldwide - its commercial arm - is planning to launch a BBC Introducing record label  i.e., an overtly commercial expansion of BBC Introducing.  This would be like the BBC trying to create a new version of the music industry, all by itself.  \nWhether or not you think it's a good thing for the beeb to champion new music, you may agree it should follow its own rules.  It hasnt.  There was no Public Value Test; no request to the Trust to be allowed to do this. \nSo we complained.  It was a bit hilarious.  The Trust said they weren't allowed to investigate until we'd complained to the beeb itself and the BBC had rejected our complaint.  There was a long pause as I tried to understand the logic.  I said Im guessing the BBC didnt do a PVT because it didnt think it needed to do a PVT.  We think they should have done.  Were asking you to investigate, to see if you agree.  They said you have to complain to them first.  Its protocol. It's all very British - i.e., charmingly polite  ludicrously bureaucratic  and totally useless.   \nSo we have another hoop to jump through. We're now preparing our formal complaint to the BBC itself - whose Director General is someone I used to work with, when we were both fresh-faced BBC trainees in 1981.  It takes time: Ill have to write it myself, and I have a business to run.  The beeb will have a small army of staff whose only job is to read it  and reject it.  (They always reject criticism; it's the BBC's default position.  They usually do it with a slightly pained expression, hurt that anyone could fail to understand their brilliance and omniscience.  Either that, or they try to demolish your intellect and cast doubt on your probity.  Either way, they'll reject it).  \nWhen they do, we'll then be able to go back to the BBC Trust to say guess what?  The BBC rejected our complaint. Now will you investigate?. Yawn. \nAll this might make me seem a BBC-hater.  Actually nothing could be further from the truth.  The BBC trained me.  I was once, so I was told by the Head of Appointments, its youngest-ever Producer.  Despite appearances, I firmly believe it's one of the best things about the UK.  I wrote to The Times of London recently in defence of it. But unfortunately it's really, really bad at understanding the damage it does to private companies, the ones like ours that create jobs and try to create wealth, without the benefit of a guaranteed income.  (Or even, any income at all).  \nThe stakes are high.  The conventional music industry is falling to bits around us. Theres an historic opportunity to re-invent music in a way that's fair to musicians and music-lovers, and also creates jobs and wealth in the real economy. It's vitally important the BBC, with its publicly-funded hobnailed boots, doesn't ruin that opportunity. \nSo well do our complaint, wait for it to be rejected, complain to the Trust, and keep battering away. Fun fun fun.  (This would never happen in the States). \n((WN)) You don't accept any PRS registered artists at all.  Why not? \n((PC)) Wed love to  after all, we have the same aim as PRS, which is to make it easier for musicians to earn a living from their talent.  But we cant.  Theres two reasons. \nI wrote to the CEO of PRS when we first launched Amazing Radio pointing out these absurdities and asking if we could do a more intelligent deal.  I said that I thought we had identical aims  to make life fair for musicians.  I suggested we could/should be a feeder to them, introducing new members to PRS as they grew in the music industry.  But so far, the PRS head is still firmly in the sand.\n((WN)) And how would you suggest PRS could improve?  If they did, would you consider allowing artists registered with them? \n((PC)) PRS could improve by;  \nIf they did that, wed sign up.  This would not necessarily be popular with our audience.  A lot of people  especially charities and small businesses  like the fact that they can listen to Amazing Radio without a PRS licence.  But wed do it anyway, as it would be a better service for musicians.  \nMy personal view is that the PRS should also stop threatening to murder law-abiding people who want to listen to music at work.  There was a recent case where they threatened someone for singing at work.  They actually did that.  They later apologized, but it revealed the corporate mentality.  I think its incredibly counter-productive; it means their members make less money, not more; its ruining perceptions of what motivates musicians; its causing thousands of people to stop listening to music.  When really, PRS should be encouraging that, shouldnt it? \n((WN)) With regard to Amazing Tunes, how many downloads could your most popular artist expect to receive per month and monetary wise, how would this compare to them receiving that number from iTunes?\n((PC)) Sorry, but we dont currently release detailed figures  our competitors would love it, but wed rather be nice to our artists and our investors instead. We do say that we expect amazingtunes.com artists to make anything from a few quid, to a good living, to a small fortune.  At the moment, because its still very early days, people are clustered towards the first two of those options.  As things grow  and theres been incredible growth even in the past few months  we hope/expect more and more artists will start to make tens of thousands of pounds each month.  Well soon register for the official chart, and our guess is that someone will have a major hit before long. Then everything will go really crazy. \nSo far as the iTunes comparisons go, the facts are already public domain. An artist on iTunes can expect to make 8p from a 79p download.  The same artist on amazingtunes.com will make about 52p.  We only deduct the VAT and the cost of the transaction: 70% of whats left goes to the artist.  Whats more, their income will improve over time - the more downloads we sell, the less the transactions cost us, so the more cash there is to give to the artists.  Thats one reason we ask people to buy eight or more songs in one transaction  its much more cost-effective, less of their cash goes to VISA, more to the artist.  (See my Blog post on this here - [1]). \n((WN)) Amazing Radio launched in mid-2009.  How has it grown since then and what are your current listening figures?\n((PC)) Its gone mad since then.  Ive worked in broadcasting and the media since 1978 (I was very very young then, mind you).  Ive never known anything like it.  The reaction has been absolutely incredible  and its growing faster than ever right now.  The most humbling thing has been the audience feedback  masses of long emails from people weve never met, saying they found it by accident, and they love it.\nWeve not yet paid for RAJAR audience figures because  well, because were a bit mean really, and Im not convinced they would accurately measure our audience.  I think RAJAR is very good at coming out with figures for radio stations that have been going for 40 years, but not very accurate when it comes to new and innovative stations which are also listened to a lot online and especially popular with young people.  But the best guess Ive heard in the industry is that we have something like 600,000 listeners in the UK on DAB.  Thats an estimate, but it came from a very wise source.  We have slightly more than that number on top as regular users online, and a weekly reach for amazingtunes.com of about two million users. But its all growing so fast, those numbers will be out of date by the time you read this. \n((WN)) DAB transmission costs are well over half a million pounds a year.  How is this being funded currently and how are you planning to fund it in the future?\n((PC)) Were not contractually allowed to tell you what we pay, so we cant confirm or deny the cost.   Whatever the true figure, it is undeniably expensive; but it gives our musicians a chance to be on national radio. We figure its worth it.  Im reminded of that wonderful teachers union bumper sticker: if you think educations expensive, try ignorance.   If you think creating the worlds first radio station playing 100% new music is expensive . try being inaudible. \nSo far, weve been funded by a very small number of private investors, people of enormous wisdom and insight, natch. They understand that we have a very serious, long-term and audacious ambition to change the music industry for the better, to make radio interesting again, and to turn the word amazing into a global challenger brand.   \nThis year, we expect to do one final fund-raising in the UK, then to raise a lot of money on the West Coast of the USA to make this absolutely massive and global, fast.  They understand this scale of ambition there.   \n((WN)) What are your plans for Amazing Radio in 2010?  Any exciting announcements to come?\n((PC)) Fraid so. \nIn 2010, we hope to make Amazing Radio the default station for everyone who has ever had that incredible experience of hearing a song for the first time, and having to stop what youre doing to listen to it: a station for everyone who has broad musical tastes, a respect for musical talent and an open mind.  We want it to be constantly surprising, fresh, original, sometimes hilarious, always unexpected.  \nBlimey, I sound like some corporate twat.   \nNow (obviously) it wouldnt be massively unexpected if we suddenly started revealing all the unexpected things in advance  but basically, wed like the message to spread that were doing something different, fresh, original and ethical - so well launch more new programmes and more new services  on Amazing Radio and amazingtunes.com.  Things like our virtual radio station Amazing Ambient.   [2].  Therell be some video and some TV along soon too.   And other cool stuff.   \nIt may not be insanely cool; just cool will do just fine. \nWe also want to do it in other places.  E.g. America. Weve already started there. Well be unexpected there too. \n((WN)) Finally, your favourite artist on Amazing Tunes/Radio at the moment?\n((PC)) Now this will sound like a real cop-out, but I never ever say who my favourite artist is.  Its for a serious reason. Im not some musical Einstein - Im merely the bloke who started amazing.  And Im merely a drummer. My taste doesnt matter. EVERYBODYs musical taste does.  One of the many problems of conventional record companies is that they think geezers in suits in big glass buildings have the right to decide whats good music.  We think the world does. Ive found hundreds of incredible songs that I love, across loads of styles of music.  Youll find hundreds of your own.  Enjoy. \n((WN)) Thank you very much for your time Paul.  Good luck for 2010.\n((PC)) Thanks very much, we really appreciate it. 2010 is going to be amazing."

It would also dole out the death penalty for any offense categorized as \"aggravated homosexuality\"meaning a case in which one of the participants is either a minor, HIV-positive, or a \"serial offender.\"  \nMuseveni stressed in this statement on Wednesday, that the Member of Parliament who drafted the legislation in question, although he is a member of the NRM, was not following government policy and did so solely as an individual.\nMuseveni, who admitted being at the center of widespread international criticism, said in the same statement that this matter was now a \"foreign policy issue,\" and therefore his government, Parliament included, \"must take into account [Uganda's] foreign policy interests.\" \nCase in point, Sweden has since threatened to cut financial support to the small African nation if this bill does in fact go through. In addition, numerous other world powers over the past weeks have contacted Museveni directly to elaborate upon their objections. \nFollowing which, a frustrated Museveni told the BBC, \"The Prime Minister of Canada came to see me and what was he talking about? Gays. Prime Minister Gordon Brown came to see me and what was he talking about? Gays. Mrs. Clinton rang me. What was she talking about? Gays.\"\nIn light of all that has occurred, Museveni told his party that the issue as of today was no longer a parliamentary one, and that it is to be discussed and handled accordingly by him and his cabinet alone.

The results are based on a telephone survey of less than 1,000 voters, 7% undecided, and with a +/-3% margin of error.\nThe seat was vacated following the August 2009 death of Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy, who had held the position since 1962. Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick originally filled the vacancy with Paul G. Kirk, a former chairman of the DNC, but he must vacate the seat later this month due to a Massachusetts Law.\nThe law, which was passed in 2004, specifies that a vacated seat must be filled by a special election. This law was passed in response to the potential vacating of the seat held by Democrat John Kerry following his possible victory in the 2004 presidential election. Under the previous law, then-Governor Mitt Romney, a Republican, would have been allowed to choose a replacement.\nCoakley led Brown in the polls for all of 2009. But things changed in January 2010, when Brown began to take a slight lead.\nIf Brown wins, Democrats will lose the 60 votes necessary for cloture to end potenial Republican Senate filibusters (to delay or prevent voting by extending debate), and to guarantee final passage of the current health care bill.\nMassachusetts has not elected a Republican Senator since Edward Brooke in 1972. \nThe election will occur this coming Tuesday."

    "reference_text": "Gilbert Arenas, a star player in the American National Basketball Association's Washington Wizards, now faces up to six months in prison after pleading guilty to felony gun possession charges today in a Washington, D.C. court. This plea was part of a plea bargain that he agreed to which would shorten his jail term if he cooperated with authorities. \nArenas, 28, was charged with the crime after he allegedly pulled an unloaded gun on a teammate in the team's locker room on December 21, which he says was a joke on the teammate. Arenas was later found to have been keeping firearms in his locker after an investigation by police and the NBA.\nMeanwhile, Arenas has been suspended for an indefinite time by NBA commissioner David Stern without pay. This action has also gained support among the Washington Wizards and its players, according to the team.\nAccording to Arenas, he stored four guns in the locker room, all of them being unloaded. When asked for his reasoning, he cited that he had young children and did not want the guns in his home around them. He also said that he did not know that keeping the guns in the locker room was a violation of Washington D.C.'s gun laws, which have grown very strict recently.\nOn December 19, two days before the incident, Arenas and teammate Javaris Crittenton got into a heated argument about gambling debts on the team's private jet. Crittenton, on whom Arenas pulled the gun, is not known whether to be carrying a gun at the time of the incident, or if he pulled the gun on Arenas. A police raid of his home yielded no results, and Crittenton has not been charged in the matter.\nAntawn Jamison, another star Wizard player and friend of Arenas, has not spoken with Arenas since he was charged. \"Hopefully he's doing better than what I'd be doing in the situation or better than I expect. But one thing about Gilbert, he's a tough-minded individual,\" Jamison commented on the situation.\n\"I'm a goof ball and that's what I am,\" says Arenas about the situation, \"So, even doing something like this, I'm going to make fun of it and that's how I am,\" he added.\nArenas, 28, has been selected to three NBA-All-Star teams. He recently scored his 10,000th career point in November. Arenas also holds the NBA record for most points scored in a single overtime period, with 16."

At around 0850 GMT on Thursday, Gibson was assisting children in crossing a road as part of her job near St. Anne's Primary School, located in the east side of the city. Gibson was suddenly struck by a truck and dragged underneath the wheels of the vehicle. The children being assisted witnessed the entire collision.\nAfter the accident occurred, Gibson was transported to a hospital but died shortly afterwards. The truck driver, who is aged 64, was not injured in the crash. The vehicle itself was taken away from the scene of the accident at approximately 1200 GMT on the same day. A person working in a garage near where the accident occurred said: \"There were children waiting to cross the road and they were all screaming and crying. They all ran back from where the accident had happened. She was found face down and it looked as though the lorry had driven over her shoulder. She was alive when she was found but died a short time later. It was horrific and the kids will probably need counselling.\n\"It could have been a case of the driver not being able to see her because the vehicle is quite high as he caught her on the passenger side. It's not clear whether she gave him enough time to stop or whether the driver has failed to stop. It was snowing as well so that could have been a factor.\"\nLouise Jarvie is the head teacher of St. Anne's Primary School. \"Our thoughts and condolences are with the family at this very sad time,\" she said in reference to the incident. \"Support and counselling for pupils and staff will be available to anyone who needs it.\""

    "reference_text": "Television ratings for Conan O'Brien's NBC program The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien have risen dramatically amidst controversy and the possibility that the host might leave the network. Nielsen ratings as of Friday showed that O'Brien's ratings were higher than CBS network's David Letterman. O'Brien also beat out Jay Leno's prime-time program, The Jay Leno Show, in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic.\nAccording to the Nielsen data, O'Brien's ratings saw a 50 percent increase over prior numbers for the season. NBC utilizes data from the 18-to-49-year-old demographic in order to determine what prices to set for advertising.\nOn Saturday, NBC was continuing to hold settlement discussions in order to allow The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien host to leave the network and replace O'Brien in the 11:35 p.m. EST time slot with former host of The Tonight Show, Jay Leno. \nO'Brien's manager, Gavin Polone, spoke positively of the ratings increase, \"People who never watched Conan before are saying, 'I'll try it.' Now they're saying, 'this is good, I'll stick with it.'\"\nPolone emphasized in a statement that O'Brien paid his own writers during the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike and was attempting to have a say with regard to the severance packages of his employees. He noted that many of O'Brien's staff members moved from New York to California when the TV host began working on The Tonight Show.\nRepresentatives for O'Brien cite poor ratings of Leno's prime-time program The Jay Leno Show, and subsequent poor ratings of NBC late local news, as having an effect on ratings of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien prior to the recent controversy.\nThe late night hosts have been discussing the recent NBC time slot controversy via jokes on their shows. O'Brien showed a skit where he had to dodge gunfire while attempting to go to work on the NBC lot. Leno made a joke referencing a statement from last year where Letterman admitted he had had affairs with women on his staff. \"Even Dave Letterman is taking shots at me, which surprised me. Usually he's just taking shots at the interns,\" said Leno. \nBill Carter of The New York Times commented that O'Brien, \"has turned the attention surrounding his departure into a ratings bonanza.\" New York Daily News noted, \"Well, at least he's going out on top,\" and commented, \"... all eyes are on him now\"."

    "reference_text": "At least seven people were killed and more than ten injured in Nairobi, Kenya on Friday when a deadly confrontation ensued between police, demonstrators, and the general public at a protest to petition the arrest of Jamaican-born radical Muslim cleric Abdullah el-Faisal.  El-Faisal was recently released from a British prison where he spent the last four years of his life for his role in various terrorist plots, including the July 2005 London Bombings.\nAfter being refused entry to his native Jamaica in addition to several East African nations, el-Faisal entered Kenya on December 24, 2009 after having gone via Nigeria, Angola, Mozambique, Swaziland, Malawi, and Tanzania.  Kenyan authorities arrested him after he was red-flagged in an immigration database.  \nWhat was at first a peaceful protest by youth members of a local group known as the Muslim Human Rights Forum soon turned violent as the demonstrators started to pelt riot police with stones and other objects.  In turn, officers retaliated at first with tear gas and water cannons, but as matters further deteriorated and some protesters attempted to stab them, the officers began to employ live ammunition, firing it into the crowd. \nLater in the day as the situation continued to deteriorate, scores of uninvolved civiliansfor reasons still unknown by the mediagot into the scuffle on the side of the police. \nFurthermore, shops adjacent to where the protest was taking place were looted and vehicles that were parked on the streets were totalled in the midst of all that was transpiring.\nAt a news conference blocks away, government spokesperson Alfred Mutua declined to comment both on the details and the police department's handling of the demonstration.  However he did say that \"[t]he government of Kenya is aware Mr. Abdullah el-Faisal has been deported from several countries for alleged recruitment, inspiration and advocating of suicide bombers.  Mr. el-Faisal is a threat to this country, because of his alleged tendencies to recruit suicide bombers.\"\nMore than 300 miles away in Mombasa, Muslims held a similar demonstration on el-Faisal's behalf that ended peacefully.\nMutua reiterated the Immigration Ministry's prior statement that el-Faisal will remain imprisoned in Kenya until they are able to send him back to Jamaica, whose government already made clear that they would not receive him.\n\"This man is so dangerous,\" said Mutua. \"No country wants to touch him.\" "
