He handed over No. 224 Group to Air Vice Marshal Christopher Foxley @-@ Norris on 30 November. \n"}, {"ended": true, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 31114, 7, 1221, 6, 3928, 5112, 1059, 4269, 1231, 9, 5, 1754, 5721, 36, 5815, 2336, 4839, 15, 973, 644, 18202, 4, 91, 21, 3873, 10, 41452, 9, 5, 9729, 9, 4213, 405, 15, 112, 902, 18069, 4, 50118, 50118, 49379], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Returning to Australia, Headlam became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff ( DCAS ) on 26 January 1965.

His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II, and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term, and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in March 1966 to plan the deployment. The year before, Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co @-@ operation role when it finally did deploy. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command, Melbourne, on 8 August 1966. Support Command had been formed in 1959, by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands. On 1 January 1968, Headlam was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff. He served as an Extra Gentleman Usher to the Queen from 17 November 1970 to 5 June 1971. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 256, 787, 12, 1039, 7383, 3772, 23, 10, 23043, 19, 256, 787, 12, 1039, 5962, 8, 163, 787, 12, 1039, 8971, 3072, 9, 18663, 2533, 4, 152, 23043, 16, 23, 10, 23043, 19, 256, 23, 10, 912, 1109, 8, 163, 23, 14, 912, 1109, 4, 50118, 448, 787, 12, 1039, 7383, 3587, 23, 277, 23043, 9, 256, 787, 12, 5214, 5962, 3072, 9, 18663, 2533, 4, 152, 8088, 16, 45, 23, 10, 23043, 19, 256, 23, 5, 912, 1109, 8, 163, 16, 23, 163, 23, 14, 912, 1109, 8, 256, 787, 12, 1039, 7383, 3587, 19, 256, 359, 163, 23, 14, 912, 1109, 4, 20, 8088, 16, 23, 10, 23043, 11, 61, 256, 8, 163, 32, 23, 5, 28952, 4, 50118, 15698, 256, 787, 12, 1039, 7383, 2012, 23, 23, 10, 23043, 9, 256, 787, 12, 5214, 5962, 3072, 9, 18663, 1075, 2533, 11, 5, 2698, 9, 83, 23, 256, 23, 10, 912, 6991, 8, 163, 23, 14, 912], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> M @-@ 82 begins at a junction with M @-@ 120 and B @-@ 96 west of Fremont.

Architecture students from around the nation and Canada are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their coursework due to numerous structures in the city having been designed by noted architects. The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born Architect Louis S. Curtiss, famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper, is extant on Highland Park. The Frank Fort designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit's famed Fisher Building. Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 31408, 34, 67, 57, 3919, 25, 5, 499, 2259, 9, 5, 5750, 4455, 8, 5528, 824, 36, 8981, 3586, 32801, 20, 5750, 9082, 2033, 5, 1114, 11, 5155, 8, 11, 1125, 24, 362, 1683, 4, 28696, 705, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 15698, 50118, 41552, 3809, 48709, 50118, 41552, 3809, 49007, 991, 15698, 133, 5750, 9251, 2763, 7, 7244, 5, 5750, 3292, 8, 5528, 824, 36, 8981, 3586, 2156, 5, 766, 9, 5, 1312, 4839, 11, 5155, 49803, 991, 48077, 8, 11, 1125, 24, 362, 1683, 19, 5, 5750, 9251, 3133, 5, 1783, 9, 1909, 5264, 36, 5, 1783, 9, 1909, 5264, 4839, 15, 644, 112, 6, 1014, 4, 28696, 705, 15698, 28696, 118, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 8061, 50118, 41552, 3809, 8061, 50118, 41552, 3809, 48709, 50118, 41552, 3809, 1380, 40635, 39114, 2630, 113, 2496, 40635, 18763, 35, 258, 131, 2788, 12], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( MAEC ).

The city originally had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites. A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African @-@ American library was demolished on May 28, 2008. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 343, 16, 5, 5402, 343, 11, 5, 31408, 6, 5750, 7438, 1070, 1018, 4121, 36, 211, 5273, 31311, 61, 1171, 4801, 787, 6, 1039, 8963, 8195, 19, 20928, 12545, 6, 20928, 29, 2485, 4, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 49666, 20, 3301, 443, 16, 5, 1154, 3301, 443, 11, 6253, 495, 5273, 6, 19, 81, 204, 6, 2965, 3925, 1730, 50, 2219, 231, 6, 151, 3925, 1730, 9, 2304, 980, 4, 28696, 15483, 49138, 1397, 1116, 2788, 15698, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 3226, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 12606, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 15483, 50118, 41552, 328, 12, 50118, 41552, 328, 12, 50118, 41552, 48546, 41552, 102, 6258, 40635, 282, 1116, 40686, 113, 48225, 40635, 8166, 640, 1401, 4, 119, 1725, 811, 4216, 4932, 1070, 2989, 4, 175, 4, 1180, 73, 8361, 73, 39472, 46479, 50118, 41552, 102, 6258, 47579, 282, 9, 40686, 108, 48225, 40635, 8166, 10431, 176, 102], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions", "generated_result": {"0": ", televsions.\n<|endoftext/> The downtown area is the largest downtown area in MSDMA, with over 4,300 square feet or approximately 6,000 square feet of retail space. <|</endof text>\n<|\n<|\n<|\n*\n<|\n**\n<|\n<|\n<!-\n<!-\n<!--<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.michianadesignatedmarket.com.au/home/images\">\n<a rel='n ofollow' href=\"http#2a"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions, televsions.\n<|endoftext/> The downtown area is the largest downtown area in MSDMA, with over 4,300 square feet or approximately 6,000 square feet of retail space. <|</endof text>\n<|\n<|\n<|\n*\n<|\n**\n<|\n<|\n<!-\n<!-\n<!--<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.michianadesignatedmarket.com.au/home/images\">\n<a rel='n ofollow' href=\"http#2a", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions.

The next morning, Lead Belly awoke to Lomax arguing with his landlord about the presence of a black man, with the landlord threatening to call the police. \n"}, {"ended": true, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 22, 20, 163, 44841, 7239, 22, 16, 65, 9, 14243, 163, 10917, 18, 144, 3395, 3686, 8, 16, 8715, 25, 39, 144, 22, 21844, 2790, 2214, 43809, 345, 16, 10, 670, 2748, 227, 5, 2214, 8, 5, 2642, 4, 28696, 3809, 1589, 49007, 3809, 1589, 49007, 3809, 48709, 133, 2214, 16, 10, 182, 1406, 65, 11, 5, 247, 8, 16, 1687, 25, 65, 9, 5, 144, 1406, 9, 5, 247, 3686, 4, 20, 11440, 59, 5, 22, 627, 44980, 1297, 22, 5, 44980, 113, 8, 22, 5, 44980, 113, 32, 182, 1406, 11, 730, 4, 20, 2214, 16, 26115, 30, 5, 1406, 13134, 930, 2690, 4, 20, 930, 16, 182, 33200, 11, 5, 247, 8, 16, 182, 157, 1982, 49069, 3809, 1589, 48709, 49138, 1397, 20168, 700, 7049, 15698], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> \" The Bourgeois Blues \" is one of Lead Belly's most famous songs and is remembered as his most \" heartfelt protest song \".

There is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics. After its release, it became popular with left @-@ wing political groups. Lead Belly was invited to perform at Camp Unity, the Communist Party USA's summer retreat, and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s. This led to the accusations that the Communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform. The party claims, to the contrary, that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform. \n"}, {"ended": true, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 22, 19719, 22, 21, 65, 9, 5, 78, 5297, 2226, 13, 10303, 27366, 15, 10, 11101, 21607, 6, 552, 19, 22, 29604, 3105, 22, 8, 22, 7543, 5463, 3697, 43809, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 2788, 15483, 1437, 1437, 1437, 22, 22, 21, 65, 9, 84, 78, 5297, 2226, 13, 10303, 27366, 11, 5, 987, 50118, 113, 22, 22, 21, 65, 9, 84, 78, 22, 22, 5297, 2226, 19, 10303, 27366, 11, 5, 987, 50118, 113, 22, 41039, 41039, 28696, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 49721, 41552, 15483, 15698, 22, 22, 1437, 1437, 1437, 22, 22, 1437, 1437, 22, 21, 65, 9, 1541, 1234, 22, 22, 1437, 1437, 49900, 15483, 1397, 20168, 1073, 49721, 49138, 1397, 20168, 1073, 15698], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> \" Sorry \" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with \" Hung Up \" and \" Future Lovers \".", "generated_result": {"0": "\n\n<|endof text|    \" \" was one of our first tracks developed for Confessions in the UK\n\" \" \" was one of our first \" \" tracks developed with Confessions in the UK\n\" \" \"\" \"\" <|endoftext>\"<|> \" \"    \" \"   \" was one of Our First \" \"   \"<|endoftag>\"</endoftag>"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> \" Sorry \" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with \" Hung Up \" and \" Future Lovers \".", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> \" Sorry \" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with \" Hung Up \" and \" Future Lovers \".\n\n<|endof text|    \" \" was one of our first tracks developed for Confessions in the UK\n\" \" \" was one of our first \" \" tracks developed with Confessions in the UK\n\" \" \"\" \"\" <|endoftext>\"<|> \" \"    \" \"   \" was one of Our First \" \"   \"<|endoftag>\"</endoftag>", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> \" Sorry \" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with \" Hung Up \" and \" Future Lovers \".

That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point. NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track.

Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left. Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end.

McDermitt Creek begins in Oregon a few miles north of The Granites and flows generally east, crossing the Oregon – Nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor of the Quinn River Valley south of McDermitt. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 22224, 5099, 17196, 32, 14092, 2260, 9, 11909, 3967, 31, 10, 15978, 17321, 14, 683, 3359, 147, 5527, 1290, 4743, 16, 452, 4, 5309, 4193, 337, 7174, 3509, 8, 5, 9285, 9, 10, 7174, 10490, 9, 2480, 15, 2480, 16, 99, 817, 5, 3152, 28934, 356, 101, 51, 32, 23187, 88, 5, 2480, 4, 50118, 50118, 15483, 41552, 642, 49526, 642, 15698, 50118, 41552, 642, 15698, 133, 22224, 5099, 17196, 11, 8920, 8, 3004, 32, 5, 144, 8694, 6485, 16296, 11, 5, 232, 4, 20, 976, 16, 184, 45, 129, 7, 5, 144, 2171, 4051, 4481, 8, 4481, 4510, 11, 5, 232, 6, 53, 34, 67, 57, 5, 184, 9, 5, 232, 17, 27, 29, 1154, 4051, 4481, 539, 4, 17801, 4481, 21, 5, 1154, 539, 11, 730, 11, 5, 6200, 29, 137, 24, 21, 22416, 30, 5, 4481, 435, 4, 17801, 12, 5691, 9787, 32, 5, 1632, 14294, 13, 2535, 9, 7892, 8, 5, 976, 16, 184], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The Trout Creek Mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today.
