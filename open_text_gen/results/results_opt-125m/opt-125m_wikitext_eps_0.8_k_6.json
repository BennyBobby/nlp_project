He handed over No. 224 Group to Air Vice Marshal Christopher Foxley @-@ Norris on 30 November. \n"}, {"ended": true, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 31114, 7, 1221, 6, 3928, 5112, 1059, 4269, 1231, 9, 5, 1754, 5721, 36, 5815, 2336, 4839, 15, 973, 644, 18202, 4, 91, 21, 3873, 10, 41452, 9, 5, 9729, 9, 2059, 11492, 36, 41452, 9, 5, 9729, 4839, 15, 112, 644, 18069, 13, 39, 544, 11, 5, 2059, 1754, 3177, 4, 50118, 50118, 49379], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Returning to Australia, Headlam became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff ( DCAS ) on 26 January 1965.

His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II, and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term, and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in March 1966 to plan the deployment. The year before, Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co @-@ operation role when it finally did deploy. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command, Melbourne, on 8 August 1966. Support Command had been formed in 1959, by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands. On 1 January 1968, Headlam was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff. He served as an Extra Gentleman Usher to the Queen from 17 November 1970 to 5 June 1971. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 256, 787, 12, 1039, 7383, 3772, 23, 10, 23043, 19, 256, 787, 12, 1039, 5962, 8, 163, 787, 12, 1039, 8971, 3072, 9, 18663, 2533, 4, 152, 23043, 16, 23, 10, 4472, 9, 59, 112, 73, 306, 7245, 4, 50118, 41552, 705, 134, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 176, 15698, 50118, 48203, 705, 246, 15698, 50118, 41552, 846, 306, 49007, 846, 245, 49007, 846, 401, 49007, 846, 398, 49007, 50118, 41552, 705, 398, 49007, 705, 466, 49007, 705, 698, 49007, 705, 1092, 49007, 705, 1558, 49007, 428, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 134, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 176, 15698, 50118, 50118, 41552, 705, 246, 15698, 50118, 41552, 705, 306, 15698, 36, 134, 43, 50118, 41552, 705, 306, 15698, 36, 176, 43, 50118, 41552, 748, 245, 1640, 134, 43, 50118, 41552, 705, 401, 49007, 705, 406, 49007, 705, 398, 49007, 705, 698, 49007, 438, 43, 50118, 41552, 705, 134, 50118, 41552, 705, 176, 41552, 705, 246, 15698, 50118, 1640, 134, 43], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> M @-@ 82 begins at a junction with M @-@ 120 and B @-@ 96 west of Fremont.

The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born Architect Louis S. Curtiss, famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper, is extant on Highland Park. The Frank Fort designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit's famed Fisher Building. Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 31408, 34, 67, 57, 3919, 25, 5, 499, 2259, 9, 5, 5750, 4455, 8, 5528, 824, 36, 8981, 3586, 32801, 20, 5750, 9082, 2033, 5, 1114, 11, 5155, 8, 11, 4013, 5, 5750, 4455, 8, 5528, 824, 36, 8981, 3586, 4839, 21, 4986, 25, 5, 1082, 9, 5, 194, 17, 27, 29, 78, 5444, 8, 4000, 1312, 13, 5, 5750, 1739, 4, 50118, 41552, 36407, 13561, 40635, 2611, 26284, 1215, 288, 113, 2496, 40635, 34001, 35, 321, 3320, 131, 49995, 36407, 1380, 48893, 22523, 40635, 17655, 113, 48709, 49138, 36407, 48077, 5, 5750, 4455, 8, 5528, 824, 36, 8981, 3586, 4839, 16, 5, 78, 9, 63, 761, 11, 5, 315, 532, 6, 8, 24, 16, 65, 5, 144, 505, 5444, 8, 4000, 5228, 11, 5, 194, 4, 20, 5750, 9251, 2033, 5, 1114, 11, 5155, 7, 1045, 5, 5750, 4455, 8, 5528, 824, 8, 8981, 2371, 4, 8981, 3586, 21, 3919, 25, 5, 1082, 9, 63, 200, 12], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( MAEC ).

The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location.

It then changes to Fm – Gm @-@ Cm in the chorus, while continuing in A ♭ – Cm – A ♭ – Fm in the intermediate verses, ultimately ending in repeated lines of \" I've heard it all before \". \n"}, {"ended": true, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 226, 4503, 3435, 5, 2214, 34, 30336, 9, 430, 11991, 217, 1515, 6, 3453, 6, 3108, 6, 5979, 6, 27428, 6, 19840, 6, 11145, 8, 2898, 4, 20, 2214, 1431, 59, 657, 6, 657, 6, 657, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 18547, 9, 14159, 15483, 18547, 9, 14159, 15483, 15698, 50118, 50118, 48203, 328, 1397, 2300, 15483, 18547, 477, 15483, 18547, 477, 15483, 18547, 477, 41552, 15698, 50118, 50118, 15483, 18547, 4937, 15483, 9309, 477, 15483, 18547, 477, 15483, 1397, 477, 15483, 1397, 477, 1721, 18547, 477, 15483, 9309, 477], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Lyrically the song has excerpts of different languages including French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Hebrew, Hindi, Polish and Japanese.

The song talks about personal empowerment and self @-@ sufficiency, denoting a shift in focus of Madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like \" Everybody \" ( 1982 ), \" Vogue \" ( 1990 ) or \" Music \" ( 2000 ) which was centered around the subject of music itself. Among the various remixes, the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston's \" I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) \" with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction. Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other, from the time they wrote the song \" Heart \" ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it. The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album Disco Four. Madonna's voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook. A breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends, leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 5583, 15838, 2675, 9, 16510, 491, 875, 14, 22, 19719, 22, 16, 5, 22, 2642, 18, 8260, 1349, 22, 8, 14, 24, 16, 10, 22, 5106, 9129, 8732, 787, 12, 8458, 72, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 28696, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 28696, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 49526, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15698, 28696, 15483, 15698, 28696, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 28696, 15483, 1397, 1529, 29015, 15698, 28696, 642, 15698, 28696, 642, 49925, 8166, 640, 1401, 4, 36666, 4, 175, 73, 11018, 116, 705, 40635, 288, 1215, 288, 1215, 288, 1215, 288, 1215, 288, 1215, 288, 30831, 49138, 642, 15698, 28696, 642, 49721, 28696, 642, 49925, 8166, 640, 1401, 12, 36666, 4, 1957, 73, 11018, 116, 506, 5214, 288, 947, 90, 5214, 176, 43, 28696, 510, 15698, 22, 19719, 22, 16, 5, 22, 2642, 18, 8260, 2642, 28696, 102, 48225, 40635, 8166, 640, 1401, 306, 4, 175, 73, 14406, 73, 119], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest track \" and that it is a \" Pet Shop Boys @-", "generated_result": {"0": "list.\"\n\n<|endoftext|> <|endoftext|> <|endoftext></endoftext> <|> <|endoftext|> <|endofftext> <p> <p>(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\"0_0_0_0_0_0)\"</p> <p>\" <p>(http://www-youtube.org/watch?f=0&t=2) <P> \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest album <a href=\"http://www4.com/video/m"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest track \" and that it is a \" Pet Shop Boys @-", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest track \" and that it is a \" Pet Shop Boys @-list.\"\n\n<|endoftext|> <|endoftext|> <|endoftext></endoftext> <|> <|endoftext|> <|endofftext> <p> <p>(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\"0_0_0_0_0_0)\"</p> <p>\" <p>(http://www-youtube.org/watch?f=0&t=2) <P> \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest album <a href=\"http://www4.com/video/m", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News wrote that \" Sorry \" is the \" album's strongest track \" and that it is a \" Pet Shop Boys @-@ esque \" song.

As the song progresses to the intermediate verses, Madonna engages in an energetic fight with her male dancers which demonstrated her bending her body and putting her leg over her head and jumping from the cage on a dancer's back. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 404, 20932, 7, 5, 23517, 5257, 12433, 6, 5, 22, 755, 4934, 22, 766, 12859, 7, 5, 292, 3598, 2137, 27465, 5516, 5, 314, 787, 12, 1039, 1004, 7467, 14, 9368, 62, 7, 5, 299, 9, 5, 6854, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 49721, 20, 22, 755, 4934, 22, 16, 10, 7648, 14, 5, 22, 755, 4934, 22, 16, 10, 7648, 14, 5, 22, 755, 4934, 22, 16, 10, 7648, 14, 5, 22, 755, 274, 22, 16, 10, 22, 18522, 274, 48336, 3358, 34133, 3358, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 14159, 15483, 15698, 85, 16, 10, 7648, 6, 45, 10, 7648, 6, 14, 5, 22, 755, 274, 22, 16, 10, 7648, 14, 5, 22, 23237, 274, 113, 36, 725, 43, 111, 3358, 3358, 16, 4, 50118, 15483, 1397, 1397, 39645, 15483, 15698, 85, 16, 10, 7648, 8, 45, 10, 22, 755, 274, 22, 5579, 3358, 4, 479, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 9309, 21600, 39645], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Alluding to the celebratory gesture, the \" High Five \" name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left @-@ turn movements that tower", "generated_result": {"0": " up to the top of the ramp.\n\n<|endoftext|>\" The \" High Five \" is a symbol that the \" High Five \" is a symbol that the \" High Five \" is a symbol that the \" High F \" is a \"High F \"-.-\"-.-.\n\n<|endof Text|> It is a symbol, not a symbol, that the \" High F \" is a symbol that the \" HIGH F\" (H) -.-.- is.\n|endendText|> It is a symbol and not a \" High F \"--.-. .\n\n<|ENDOFText"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> Alluding to the celebratory gesture, the \" High Five \" name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left @-@ turn movements that tower", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> Alluding to the celebratory gesture, the \" High Five \" name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left @-@ turn movements that tower up to the top of the ramp.\n\n<|endoftext|>\" The \" High Five \" is a symbol that the \" High Five \" is a symbol that the \" High Five \" is a symbol that the \" High F \" is a \"High F \"-.-\"-.-.\n\n<|endof Text|> It is a symbol, not a symbol, that the \" High F \" is a symbol that the \" HIGH F\" (H) -.-.- is.\n|endendText|> It is a symbol and not a \" High F \"--.-. .\n\n<|ENDOFText", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> Alluding to the celebratory gesture, the \" High Five \" name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left @-@ turn movements that tower over the landscape.

The construction contract for the High Five Interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts. For example, it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete's strength ( the first time TxDOT had ever done so ), and contained an early completion bonus, a sliding scale of up to $ 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years. Also built into the construction contract was a provision that Zachry was charged for \" lane rentals \" by TxDOT for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on hourly assessments and the time of day the lane was closed. The fees ranged from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @,@ 000 for rush hours. In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction, the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and viaducts so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed.

Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, which was then beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17 million years ago, in the Miocene. The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land now known as the Trout Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 4007, 8175, 8362, 2582, 20419, 102, 16, 10, 5395, 5473, 26374, 1905, 11, 5, 22224, 5099, 17196, 4, 20, 31638, 787, 12, 1039, 14216, 13011, 3624, 102, 16, 10, 7793, 13011, 3624, 102, 6, 8, 16, 65, 11, 5, 22224, 5099, 17196, 4, 20, 13011, 3624, 102, 16, 59, 132, 6, 151, 1730, 251, 8, 59, 112, 6, 151, 1730, 6764, 36, 176, 6, 151, 475, 322, 20, 13011, 3624, 102, 16, 2034, 11, 5, 22224, 5099, 17196, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 50118, 50118, 41552, 328, 10975, 134, 742, 50118, 50118, 41552, 328, 10975, 245, 742, 50118, 50118, 41552, 48546, 10975, 134, 742, 50118, 50118, 41552, 328, 10975, 401, 742, 50118, 50118, 41552, 328, 10975, 406, 742, 50118, 50118, 41552, 328, 41552, 328, 10975, 398, 742, 50118, 50118, 41552, 12846, 10975, 466, 15698, 50118, 50118, 15483, 41552, 328, 10975, 698, 742, 50118, 50118, 41552, 328, 10975, 1225, 742, 1437, 46580, 5579, 50140], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The broad McDermitt Caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the Trout Creek Mountains.
