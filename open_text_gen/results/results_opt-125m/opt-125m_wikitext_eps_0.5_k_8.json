His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II, and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term, and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in March 1966 to plan the deployment. The year before, Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch, the Chief of the Air Staff, that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton, and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co @-@ operation role when it finally did deploy. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command, Melbourne, on 8 August 1966. Support Command had been formed in 1959, by merging the RAAF's former Training and Maintenance Commands. On 1 January 1968, Headlam was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff.

Dani Moure, another reviewer from the same site, noted about his battle with Temari during the Chunin Exams that it was \" one of the better fights involving the supporting players \". \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 1223, 16353, 71, 5, 997, 6, 5, 343, 2867, 10, 22, 3274, 8927, 22, 24, 555, 5, 1154, 343, 11, 5750, 227, 37708, 8, 15891, 6, 8, 10, 981, 1312, 13, 1704, 12, 4310, 750, 6, 2040, 359, 4000, 4, 85, 21, 5, 1154, 8, 1154, 343, 751, 7995, 6, 19, 65, 153, 3925, 12, 22023, 36, 466, 6, 3913, 3925, 7679, 43, 9, 980, 36, 176, 6, 151, 17895, 4, 16935, 1592, 9, 63, 308, 4, 50118, 49138, 36407, 15698, 50118, 41552, 48546, 50118, 41552, 36407, 2496, 40635, 48921, 111, 314, 35, 389, 38740, 321, 207, 321, 131, 28716, 12, 44022, 35, 1312, 131, 49853, 36407, 8061, 28696, 36407, 1380, 40635, 42060, 12, 11127, 18620, 12, 42060, 12, 620, 39717, 113, 2496, 48893, 1270, 40635, 46479, 947, 282, 387, 131, 49138, 102, 49007, 36407, 48225, 49007, 36407, 2496, 40635, 29015, 12, 11127, 18620, 12, 42060, 46479, 10431, 134, 1704, 12, 1791, 7, 28, 1440, 11, 5, 220], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Rebuilt after the war, the city entered a \" Golden Age \" it become the largest city in Mississippi between 1890 and 1930, and a leading center for", "generated_result": {"0": " African-American history, culture & entertainment.

The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born Architect Louis S. Curtiss, famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper, is extant on Highland Park. The Frank Fort designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit's famed Fisher Building. Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair, the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had Lalique lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 31408, 34, 67, 57, 3919, 25, 5, 499, 2259, 9, 5, 5750, 4455, 8, 5528, 824, 36, 8981, 3586, 32801, 20, 5750, 9082, 2033, 5, 1114, 11, 5155, 8, 11, 5241, 6, 5, 194, 9, 5750, 14673, 5, 5750, 4455, 8, 4000, 1463, 36, 448, 13709, 322, 20, 256, 20014, 16, 855, 5, 4351, 9, 5, 8981, 717, 13, 5, 5750, 4455, 8, 5528, 824, 18, 709, 4, 50118, 1121, 1285, 7, 5, 8981, 3586, 6, 256, 13709, 40, 67, 790, 41, 5984, 8, 4106, 1312, 6, 10, 5707, 6, 41, 4000, 7364, 6, 5444, 6, 1265, 518, 13, 5, 521, 6, 5444, 2644, 6, 10, 7364, 4535, 6, 10, 930, 931, 4535, 6, 930, 8, 3836, 14991, 19, 10, 7364, 931, 4535, 4, 50118, 448, 13709, 40, 67, 28, 184, 7, 10, 739, 3143, 15, 1082, 9, 5, 5750, 4455, 3502, 4, 50118, 50118, 1121, 1285, 7, 5, 8981, 3586, 6, 97, 256, 2620, 3586, 1377, 680], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Meridian has also been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( MAEC ).

The city originally had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites. A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African @-@ American library was demolished on May 28, 2008. \n"}, {"ended": true, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 343, 16, 5, 5402, 343, 11, 5, 31408, 6, 5750, 7438, 1070, 1018, 4121, 36, 211, 5273, 31311, 61, 1171, 4801, 787, 6, 1039, 8963, 8195, 19, 20928, 12545, 6, 7796, 359, 2888, 899, 4, 28696, 26037, 1380, 40635, 1399, 2788, 882, 12, 1399, 12, 14691, 2788, 49995, 26037, 1380, 40635, 1399, 12, 46740, 2788, 46479], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions", "generated_result": {"0": ", computers & internet access. <div class=\"field text field-field-title text\"><div class=\"field-items text\">"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions, computers & internet access. <div class=\"field text field-field-title text\"><div class=\"field-items text\">", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> The city is the principal city in the Meridian, Mississippi Designated Market Area ( DMA ), which includes 72 @,@ 180 households with televisions.

There was no loss of life, but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the skerries in 1979, and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present Search and Rescue helicopter unit, based at Sumburgh Airport. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 6466, 2543, 154, 16, 5, 1049, 20952, 9, 2946, 301, 4, 38112, 1026, 5, 24456, 9, 5, 7119, 866, 53, 10, 5845, 13945, 32, 1682, 6, 217, 9440, 6, 20385, 6, 19768, 50, 20385, 4, 1437, 38, 348, 57, 7, 5, 11280, 8, 5, 2946, 9, 2487, 6, 8, 38, 348, 393, 450, 5, 6466, 17477, 230, 10595, 137, 4, 50118, 50118, 100, 348, 67, 1317, 14, 5, 230, 26167, 11, 9948, 330, 261, 282, 3343, 16, 10, 372, 317, 7, 213, 5651, 4, 50118, 1640, 2409, 38, 348, 460, 57, 174, 24, 938, 75, 182, 205, 13, 16516, 6, 53, 38, 348, 393, 57, 89, 2185, 1592, 50118, 100, 67, 1317, 14, 5, 9948, 330, 261, 7468, 16, 41, 443, 7, 825, 114, 47, 214, 164, 5651, 4, 50118, 2409, 38, 348, 1317, 10, 319, 9, 205, 383, 59, 5, 6466, 17477, 230, 20734, 8, 5, 230, 26167, 11, 6466, 17477, 1777, 4, 85, 18, 10, 269, 2579], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> Crofting is the mainstay of island life.

On the first night Lead Belly and his wife Martha spent in the city, they encountered racially discriminatory Jim Crow laws similar to those found in their native Louisiana : most hotels refused to rent rooms to African Americans and the few that would were either full or refused to serve him because he was with a white man ( Lomax ). Lomax, in some versions of the story described as an unnamed \" white friend \", offered to let the couple stay for the night in his apartment near the Supreme Court Building. The next morning, Lead Belly awoke to Lomax arguing with his landlord about the presence of a black man, with the landlord threatening to call the police. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 22, 20, 163, 44841, 7239, 22, 16, 65, 9, 14243, 163, 10917, 18, 144, 3395, 3686, 8, 16, 8715, 25, 39, 144, 22, 21844, 2790, 2214, 43809, 345, 16, 10, 319, 9, 930, 11, 39, 930, 6, 53, 24, 16, 45, 39, 144, 1406, 8, 157, 12, 6421, 930, 4, 50118, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 49007, 15483, 22, 20, 163, 5137, 163, 11175, 9, 22, 50118, 113, 16, 65, 9, 5, 144, 3395, 930, 3686, 9, 5, 291, 212, 3220, 35, 50118, 627, 2214, 16, 10, 2214, 30, 163, 9718, 3025, 6, 163, 4134, 257, 6, 14, 1575, 10, 346, 9, 430, 3686, 4, 50118, 50118, 49138, 1397, 1116, 32903, 15698, 1437, 1437, 8061, 28696, 15483, 1397, 1116, 32903, 15698, 8061, 22, 163, 4134, 257, 6, 20, 163, 8141, 163, 8849, 22, 16, 163, 4134, 257, 12905, 417, 12905, 29, 144, 1406, 2214, 36, 463, 65, 5, 144, 3395, 3686, 9, 70, 43, 8, 16], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> \" The Bourgeois Blues \" is one of Lead Belly's most famous songs and is remembered as his most \" heartfelt protest song \".

There is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics. After its release, it became popular with left @-@ wing political groups. Lead Belly was invited to perform at Camp Unity, the Communist Party USA's summer retreat, and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s. This led to the accusations that the Communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform. The party claims, to the contrary, that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform. \n"}, {"ended": true, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 22, 19719, 22, 21, 65, 9, 5, 78, 5297, 2226, 13, 10303, 27366, 15, 10, 11101, 21607, 6, 552, 19, 22, 29604, 3105, 22, 8, 22, 7543, 5463, 3697, 43809, 50118, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 39645, 1721, 1437, 1437, 8061, 22, 20, 2214, 14, 16, 5, 144, 1537, 4782, 11, 5, 1349, 6, 19, 5, 22, 41416, 3105, 46481, 24, 16, 5, 144, 341, 2214, 11, 5, 2642, 4, 22, 29604, 22, 16, 5, 144, 5705, 702, 2214, 11, 5, 22, 4771, 102, 18606, 1643, 113, 2642, 4, 50118, 41552, 328, 41552, 15483, 1397, 20168, 9506, 687, 636, 15483, 15698, 22, 29604, 128, 282, 108, 5463, 22, 36, 627, 2214, 9, 657, 43, 111, 22, 29604, 128, 1187, 5463, 22, 36, 627, 3686, 9, 5, 657, 43, 111, 22, 29604, 22896, 6852, 22, 8, 5, 22, 44485, 732, 1439, 128, 282, 75, 22, 36, 627, 1652, 14, 32, 174, 11, 42, 2214, 43], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> \" Sorry \" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with \" Hung Up \" and \" Future Lovers \".", "generated_result": {"0": "\n<|endofText |   > \" The song that is the most common theme in the track, with the \"Hung Up \", it is the most used song in the album. \" Hung \" is the most frequently played song in the \"Cha Cha Party\" album.\n<!<|endofthemusic|> \" Hung 'n' Lo \" (the song of love) - \" Hung 'nd Lo \" (the songs of the love) - \" Hung \"'ns \" and the \"Chan Chai 'n't \" (the stories that are told in this song)"}, "prompt": "<|endoftext|> \" Sorry \" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with \" Hung Up \" and \" Future Lovers \".", "gen_text": "<|endoftext|> \" Sorry \" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with \" Hung Up \" and \" Future Lovers \".\n<|endofText |   > \" The song that is the most common theme in the track, with the \"Hung Up \", it is the most used song in the album. \" Hung \" is the most frequently played song in the \"Cha Cha Party\" album.\n<!<|endofthemusic|> \" Hung 'n' Lo \" (the song of love) - \" Hung 'nd Lo \" (the songs of the love) - \" Hung \"'ns \" and the \"Chan Chai 'n't \" (the stories that are told in this song)", "reference_text": "<|endoftext|> \" Sorry \" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance Floor, along with \" Hung Up \" and \" Future Lovers \".

After two straight second @-@ place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside, Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside the second row. That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point. NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track. It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps, and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields. Two hours later, the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third. After Richmond's car was adjusted to remove the \" push \", the car was more to his liking. Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left. Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end. After Richmond took the lead with 30 laps left in the race, Dale Earnhardt made up three seconds on Richmond's five @-@ second lead. With four laps to go, Buddy Arrington spun in a three @-@ car accident. The remaining laps of the race where completed slowly under caution and Richmond took the checkered flag for the victory. He had led 97 laps, including the final 30, taking his first victory in a Rick Hendrick car. \n"}, {"ended": false, "tokens": [2, 41552, 15483, 1397, 1116, 29015, 15483, 15698, 20, 2106, 1835, 7, 12912, 16405, 10, 353, 423, 6, 8, 7851, 12248, 13, 277, 1124, 11, 10, 11048, 787, 12, 1039, 30288, 515, 4, 96, 5, 507, 290, 787, 12, 1039, 29, 58, 351, 30, 5, 849, 134, 5018, 6, 849, 306, 5018, 6, 849, 245, 6, 849, 306, 6, 849, 245, 8, 172, 849, 406, 6, 19, 787, 12, 787, 29, 5614, 11, 5, 299, 290, 9, 358, 515, 6, 8, 5, 849, 134, 18008, 6, 849, 306, 5018, 359, 849, 245, 11, 5, 1374, 515, 11, 5, 507, 4, 50118, 1121, 127, 2473, 6, 849, 245, 21, 41, 1365, 1015, 6, 53, 38, 21, 5779, 45, 1298, 5, 849, 246, 515, 30, 10, 477, 4, 38, 437, 2818, 5, 849, 134, 2073, 11, 5, 849, 176, 16, 615, 4, 50118, 50118, 1620, 13, 849, 406, 38, 21, 45, 5779, 4, 849, 406, 21, 10, 372, 1015, 1374, 6, 5, 849, 134, 18008, 6, 5, 200, 18008], "prefix_text": "<|endoftext|> The tour returned to Pocono a month later, and Richmond battled for another victory in a fog @-@ shortened event.
